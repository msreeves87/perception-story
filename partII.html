          <h3>Part II</h3>
          <p>16 months have past since the blaze at the club. Carl and Jennifer had left the United States, and moved to London. Jennifer is starting in a new play as the lead, this is off the success of playing on shows in Las Vegas and playing on Broadway as Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls.
          <p>The relationship between the two is a flourishing one when they left the States and moved to London, though it has been tricky as they both had to deal with the aftermath and the deaths of Kiera, Ritchie and Joey. It was rocky at times, but they have over time had built trust with each other.</p> 
          <p>But since they are working away, they have been taking a lot of time separately.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Jennifer is becoming an entrepreneur as she has put her name into other ventures, like the fashion industry. She is a shareholder in one of the leading fashion companies; she has a company that provides celebrities with their own fashion and perfume ranges. She has become one of the leading faces in the fashion industry in Europe.</p>
          <p>This has also being helped by her recognition from her roles in the theatre, being in Las Vegas as an entertainer and the obvious money she not only got from the bank heist with the wealth from her dead husband. So why does she go into theatre working? Because the simple reason is she can and she loves every minute of it. She has built a huge clientele list from many business parties and other social events.</p>
          <p>She is in rehearsal rooms for longer hours with a smile on her face mixed with the natural pressures of performing. She is constantly working with new people who she laughs and jokes with all of the staff. The company is one of the most accomplished in the West End with hosting shows like Lion King, Chicago and many more. </p>
          <p>For any actor, there is always the question of which area would they go into, the theatre or the T.V/Film industry. She did try her hand into the film industry, but after a couple of films with cameo/minor roles, she did find it less rewarding. She doesn’t get the same buzz of excitement compared to perform in front of a live audience.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>On the final week of rehearsals towards the end of the week, Jennifer walks down one of the corridors in the theatre. Her role is a executive producer as well as leading role in the latest play on show called Guys and Dolls, perks of running a company in the entertainment world. As she makes a turning, she starts hearing music down one of the corridors; it was after hours so she was intrigued of who would be there.</p>
          <p>As she peers around the door with interest, she sees a girl practising some dance steps. She is young, pretty and keen, in her twenties only a couple years younger than Jennifer. Her name is Annabelle who is playing the supporting role in this plays in which Annabelle and Jennifer have become close during the rehearsals. Jennifer has a smile on her face as she watches her practice, she sees a friendship developing like the one she had with Kiera. She sees Annabelle quick and agile, light on her feet doing tap dance and with flawless dance moves.</p>
          <p>As she finishes and cools down a little, she changes tact as she prepares to practice her singing, the music changes track into Gabrielle Cilmi’s “Sweet about Me”. Her voice came to Jennifer’s’ attention during a charity event for a fashion show. Annabelle was performing for charity, Jennifer as executive producer saw an opportunity with her. </p>
          <p>So during fashion week she attended the show, she was in the front row sitting next to fashion designers, celebrities, paparazzi and divas. Jennifer couldn’t think of anything worse, but found it to be very crucial at the time as one of the models walking on the catwalk was Annabelle. She knew that she had to get her because there was something in her that she liked when she saw her perform, she knew that at least she can get her to audition for a role in the play.</p>
          <p>So when the show ended, Jennifer went to the shows’ organiser, who escorts her to the backstage area. They find Annabelle getting dressed while all the rest of the models is leaving.</p>
          <p>After the last girl left the room;</p>
          <p>“Is this the girl you are after?” the organiser inquires.</p>
          <p>“Yes it is.” Jennifer replies.</p>
          <p>Annabelle turns around hearing this wondering what is going on, she looking a little worried as she thinks she might have done something wrong.</p>
          <p>“What is your name my dear?” the organiser asks while checking on her clipboard in her reading glasses and silk top with business trousers.</p>
          <p>“Annabelle.” She replies trying to speak with confidence. The organiser checks her board where she goes to the name Annabelle.</p>
          <p>“Can you leave us for a bit please?” Jennifer asks the organiser.</p>
          <p>“No problem, I’ll treat you to some food at one of the leading restaurants in London.”</p>
          <p>“Absolutely, as long it isn’t chilli again.” As she giggles a little knowing it was too hot for her and doesn’t want again any time soon, She hugs the organiser as she leaves.</p>
          <p>Annabelle puts on her shirt on, Jennifer looks her up and down as she circles her and profiles her. Jennifer goes to the nearest seat and Annabelle goes to sit opposite her slightly nervous.</p>
          <p>“So Annabelle, where you from?”</p>
          <p>“I was born in Kent then moved here a couple of years ago.“</p>
          <p>“So do you like all this?”</p>
          <p>“Modelling?.. I do…” Annabelle struggling to say what she feels.</p>
          <p>“But?”</p>
          <p>“I have been doing this for a year now, I enjoy it but I started to perform on the side.”</p>
          <p>“I saw at the charity do, I love your singing, I think you have something.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks I appreciate it, I started doing it because it is something that fills the void you know.”</p>
          <p>“I know what you mean” Jennifer reflecting on the club and shows. “You ever thought of acting?”</p>
          <p>“Singing is more my thing.”</p>
          <p>“These days, you can sing, you can act, it is all about entertaining someone. Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera in Nashville. There is a role in this play I am in which I think you would be perfect for.”</p>
          <p>“What you are director too?” she smiles.</p>
          <p>“Executive Producer and lead.”</p>
          <p>“Don’t think any of those people did theatre.”</p>
          <p>“Should though.”</p>
          <p>Annabelle smiles “You just going to put me in a role?”</p>
          <p>“No, that would be silly, there are auditions this week in the next couple of days, come down and give it a shot…you got nothing to lose.” Jennifer gives her a business card and a flyer of the details about the play at the theatre.</p>
          <p>Annabelle looks at it, Jennifer heads to the exit and meets up with the organiser. They head out and go to dinner, Jennifer looking happy as this could happen for Annabelle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Back in the Rehearsal room, Jennifer continues to watch Annabelle sing. Jennifer enters the room and walks towards Annabelle. Annabelle stops as she seeing her coming through the mirrors and hearing high heels on the wooden floor.</p>
          <p>“You sounding good.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks.” Annabelle is being modest.</p>
          <p>Jennifer stands next to her as they both look through the mirror, rubbing her shoulder like a trainer does to a boxer joking around.</p>
          <p>“You ready for the show?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah.” Annabelle laughing.</p>
          <p>“Awesome, your boyfriend coming to see you?”</p>
          <p>“No, he is still in Spain working.”</p>
          <p>Suddenly through the reflection of Annabelle she pictures Kiera, it seems not be the first time this has happened as she starts to laugh and turns around and looks back at the mirror to see Annabelle. She is starting to get visions of her, which was becoming more and more frequent lately.</p>
          <p>“You ok?”</p>
          <p>“I’m fine, I have to go get my stuff and get some food.”</p>
          <p>“I’ll come if you want.”</p>
          <p>“I’m in a rush sorry, I’ll just pick up a sandwich on the way home. I’ll see you on stage tomorrow ok?” as she looking white faced and heads out the door.</p>
          <p>This problem started when she was first working with Annabelle and they get close. They started to get close which was taking Jennifer back to her times with Kiera. But Jennifer seems to cope at first thinking of Kiera, but as they develop as friends in this final week, she has started to picture and hear Kiera that is starting to freak her out. </p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>She heads down the corridor and gets out her phone.</p>
          <p>“Hey babe…I’m ok just wanting your voice…yeah just finished, you home?...course your not, ok I’ll see you whenever…bye babe bye.”</p>
          <p>Jennifer hangs up the phone.</p>
          <p>“See you later babes.” Carl puts down the phone a little confused by her tone as he looks on at the club. He turns around in the club to see his secretary with a smile on his face.</p>
          <p>They have been distance, as Carl owns his own club. She heads out the main entrance door and goes into her Mercedes and drives home. She stops into a petrol station and picks up a sandwich and a bottle of vodka on the way home.</p>
          <p>The club is a high-class place that is as tall as a coliseum, which is exclusive to the rich and famous. The club has all kinds of clientele; rappers/celebrities/ footballers mixed with agents, P.R, anyone with a large bank account, you can see them all dancing on a massive oval dance floor. The outside is lined by a red carpet filled with paparazzi that are controlled by two massive bouncers and metal railings. It brings in massive success and is the most recognisable clubs in the U.K, which was largely helped financially from the money he got from the bank heist.</p>
          <p>For the first time in a long time, Carl does feel in a good place mentally. He is meeting new people every day as he is always looking for new business opportunities, everyday meeting executives. The days of underhanded business dealings with crooks are over in his mind. </p>
          <p>He does have his vices though, in a club with beautiful women, he seem to be tempted by a nice pair of legs in a mini skirt, but he has resisted because of turning over a new leaf with Jennifer. He doesn’t fancy having a sexual harassment lawsuit from his staff, as most of them are female. One member of the bar staff and the two bouncers are the only male staff he has. </p>
          <p>The one vice he still has is he can’t stop using his fist to resolve issues. At times in any club there are people who will try their luck to sell drugs in the club. Carl is like a hawk and will swoop straight down there and send any drug dealer out the front door with his right hook and a flash of his gun under his suit, instead of the normal procedure of getting the bouncers to escort them out. The same would be for any blokes starting fights or getting nasty or too friendly with woman in the club. It does bring tension to his vice to beautiful women as he is consoling these devastated/vulnerable women.</p>
          <p>He has gone t-totalled, as he has seen enough people in the club off their face; he has been there many times when he was at their lowest point. He works out regularly, taking MMA training from one of the most successful trainers in sports. He wants to be as physically fit, as he is routine from when he was in the marines and the CIA.</p>
          <p>He does now have an active life nowadays with his finger on the pulse with everything that happens in his business, but his business dealings isn’t so perfect that he thinks they are thought. The problem nine times out of ten is that whenever Carl is given a business opportunity, it isn’t the full picture.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>One day in his club, a businessman with a shady reputation had offered him a club in Newcastle, but it wasn’t legit at all. The businessman has being involved with criminal activity, he has being known for murder, theft and other activities like smuggling, just like Carl was being involved with when he was working with Joey. He has being tempted to go back into that world at times since leaving Las Vegas, but has always managed to stay straight and he declined that the businessman’s’ offer.</p>
          <p>The man left the club, demands his car by threating the valet, impatiently waits and shoves the valet out of the way when his car arrives. He angrily gets in his car and drives off. The man gets on the phone; changes to calm almost worried as he dials the phone.</p>
          <p>“It’s me, he didn’t go for it.”</p>
          <p>“Why not?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t now why, I’ll try again though.”</p>
          <p>“Forget it, get back here ASAP.” The man on the other line hangs up the phone; it is Ritchie’s older brother James. He is in the CIA but is on leave after he wasn’t using his best judgement during the trial of his brothers’ case.</p>
          <p>It has turned into obsession for the truth into what happened isn’t clear – cut as the evidence for James leads to Carl. During the investigation the two bureaus LAPD and CIA had conflicted over the case. The CIA were trying to see that the Turks had been responsible, the LAPD tried to see that Joey was responsible for it. </p>
          <p>James did his own investigation and started getting closer with some developments. He managed to get a witness moments before the blaze through his own unique methods, he found that someone saw Carl driving in one car, with Ritchie driving in another car behind him with an injured Joey in the back of Ritchie’s’ car. He went further and found that Jennifer was the owner of the club she worked at. He worked off the fact that Carl was working with the Marciano family and started gathering pieces of the puzzle to finally get to the bottom of this. When he found that they both left for the U.K at certain times, he went to London after finding that Carl owns the club.</p>
          <p>When James found that Jennifer was at the London Fashion show, he knew he had to make his move. He left his family in the United States believing that he is on duty overseas. He hasn’t really grieved properly for his brother he rather work than deal with it, he does feel like he could do something about it despite the fact death is the risk will in the line of duty in his profession, to be honest he doesn’t really care.</p>
          <p>He has a penthouse rented in London as a base where he has all the information pinned on boards to work out what is going on. He has giving himself an alias as a talent agent called Joseph Chambers, who is looking to expand his client list in London as a cover story.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>He started surveillance on Annabelle after she joined the play, as it was a way to get close to Jennifer. James had to become her agent after he found out that Annabelle would be in the supporting role of the play Jennifer is in that play.</p>
          <p>On a particular evening, Carl heads into his penthouse apartment after returning from his club, James was waiting outside and is starting to see through that maybe Carl isn’t involved because he has not being spotted with Jennifer, as he doesn’t know they are a couple. He may to put all his time in Jennifer at the West End; James only started watching Carl two weeks ago and Jennifer hasn’t been home since. He found it difficult to keep tabs on both of them. He seems to believe more that it was Jennifer as she is the widow, and has seemed to down pretty done well for herself since his death. So that’s exactly what he decided to do is put all of his efforts on her.</p>
          <p>So a week before rehearsals he starts putting the wheels in motion. He started to work on Annabelle; he tailed Jennifer and found that she was talking to Annabelle at the fashion show. He convinces Annabelle, giving her the gift of the gab to ditch her agent and take him on board; he showed that his expertise is in moulding singer/entertainers into actors. He had also convinced the current agent in his own way to leave Annabelle and look for someone new.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Both Jennifer and Annabelle head to the wardrobe department in the theatre. They checked out the outfits that are hanging on the rails. They take them off the hanger, and place them in front of their bodies as they pose in the mirror. In the room they meet the leading man called Kyle who plays the male lead. He is handsome, baby face and athletic build. Even though he is only 22, he has so much experience of shows through his teenage years by picking the brains of some the most talented/experienced performers that he has worked with. He has become a hot property to directors while he has rose to fame.</p>
          <p>“What do you girls think?” as he poses in this outfit.</p>
          <p>“Wow, definitely look the part.” Annabelle looking at him impressed by what she is seeing.</p>
          <p>“Very nice Kyle, you nervous?” as Jennifer is looking through the rail of clothes, she then looks up and pictures Kiera again in the reflection of the mirror, while Annabelle is posing with the outfit in the mirror. She quickly puts her head back down at the rail.</p>
          <p>“A little, it’s my first lead so it’s going to be tough because of the critics.” as he looks over the outfit in the mirror.</p>
          <p>“You will be fine, when the curtain raises you will be in the moment and nothing else matters isn’t that right Jennifer… Jennifer?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah, sorry that’s right.” Jennifer trying to get her words out.</p>
          <p>A technician comes into the room and calls Jennifer and Annabelle to the stage.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>They both head to the stage walking through the many corridors, as they approach the main hall with a large oval stage with a large red curtains. They come onto the stage where two mics are placed on each side of each other with a piano on the side of the stage, a man waiting to play sitting at the piano. The seats are mostly empty except the front row where the director, producers, some other important people with the technical people waiting at their stations. In the top corner not visible is James checking out for anything.</p>
          <p>Jennifer stands at her mic stand; she is not looking confident as she prepares to sing. Annabelle at the other mic stand looking excited very confident as she prepares her vocals. Jennifer looks out and things start to go blurry like everything is melting in front of her, she tries to sing or even speak but nothing is coming out. So she quickly heads to the backstage and checking the coast is clear, moves pieces of equipment to reveal a bag, she then gets out a bottle of vodka and drinks out of it.</p>
          <p>She then composes herself and goes back on stage looking more confident as she approaches the mic stand.</p>
          <p>“You ok Jen?” Annabelle wondering.</p>
          <p>“Yeah absolutely, ready guys?” she speaks out towards the others waiting for her in the seats.</p>
          <p>“From the top, just a couple of runs girls.” The director instructs and points to the technician, and the music starts. They both start to perform, Annabelle happy singing but Jennifer singing is trying to raise a smile in order to reassure herself she can do this.</p>
          <p>As the song finishes and they stop practicing, Jennifer heads out quickly to the exit not even saying goodbye to anyone. As she heads out the front door and gets into her car, she gets out her phone and goes to the contacts and stops at Carl’s name, she clicks a couple more times and waits as the phone rings.</p>
          <p>“Where are you now?........ Can you come to my place, its important……….an hour? Great see you then.” She hangs up the phone and drives off, James comes out and spots Jennifer’s car down the street and gets after her in his car.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Jennifer is back home in her dressing gown sitting on the sofa. She goes to the kitchen and gets out a bottle of wine and two glasses. The doorbell rings, she rushes to the mirror to check herself as she heads to the front door. She opens it and it is Kyle waiting at the front door perplexed as Jennifer invites him in. James parked in a car manages to get pictures of Kyle going in.</p>
          <p>They head into the dining room.</p>
          <p>“Ok Jennifer, why did you call me down here?”</p>
          <p>“Just need to chat, rough day you know…. here have a drink.”</p>
          <p>“Where’s your husband?” as he looks at the photo frame of Jennifer and Carl together.</p>
          <p>“Carl?...... We are not married, I don’t really see him that much recently in the last year.”</p>
          <p>“Where is he?”</p>
          <p>“He has a club in the West of London and his own place there, sort of separated for the moment, he is preparing to go up to Newcastle looking at another club and a place maybe for us.”</p>
          <p>“Sounds like fun.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah don’t know though.”</p>
          <p>“Why not Newcastle is beautiful and to be back with Carl?..... Would you still perform?....In the theatre I mean?”</p>
          <p>“That’s not important right now, come and sit with me.” As she offer him a drink.</p>
          <p>“Listen I appreciate it, but I don’t drink during the touring of the show.” Kyle goes down next to her on the sofa.</p>
          <p>“Ok, more for me.” she drinks down a glass of wine.</p>
          <p>“You ok?”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
          <p>“Annabelle was concerned, she said you have being acting weird lately, I told her it might be nerves.”</p>
          <p>“That Annabelle, nice girl but always about something that isn’t there.”</p>
          <p>“She isn’t the only one, I’m concerned and there have been some people noticing that you have being a little erratic lately.”</p>
          <p>“Its just nerves, honestly once the show starts I’ll be ok.”</p>
          <p>Jennifer moves closer to Kyle and starts to be flirty with him and goes to kiss him. Kyle surprised and shrugs her off. “What you doing?” Kyle gets up and goes to the front door. Jennifer embarrassed with what she just tried to do and comes after him and stops him at the front door.</p>
          <p>“Listen, I’m sorry, I haven’t seen Carl so I’ve been on my own for a while, mixed with the stress and the drink…it has just all piled up on me.”</p>
          <p>“Annabelle is here to help with all this…girl stuff.” Kyle is not being able to know what to say.</p>
          <p>Jennifer smiles “You are a good kid.” Jennifer gets close to Kyle again, which makes him nervous.</p>
          <p>“Oh come on, I aint going to jump on you.” Jennifer hugs him and kisses him on the cheek.</p>
          <p>As they embrace, James has taken pictures on his phone. He knows it could be useful for discrediting her at the theatre as leverage to later on to get the information he needs off her. Innocent situations by Jennifer have being fabricated from the photos with a range of men, whether it was a kiss, or hug or her wearing something that could be mistaken for sleazy which James has collected.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>As time went on, Jennifer is managing to get through the rehearsal and the preview weeks. But as the day of the opening night draws closer, Jennifer visions are becoming more and more frequent and she starts to drink more frequently which seems to relax her at times. But she then starts hearing Kiera as she performed, in her dreams more frequently that are causing her sleepless nights. </p>
          <p>On the last night of the preview week before the critics arrive for viewing the show.

          <p>As time went on, Jennifer is managing to get through the rehearsal and the preview weeks. But as the day of the opening night draws closer, Jennifer visions are becoming more and more frequent and she starts to drink more frequently which seems to relax her at times. But she then starts hearing Kiera as she performed, in her dreams more frequently that are causing her sleepless nights. </p>
          <p>On the last night of the preview week before the critics arrive for viewing the show. During the last break before the last big number to close the show, Annabelle was getting very suspicious of Jennifer that has being building over the last couple of weeks. She then bursts in Jennifer dressing room and catches her drinking vodka and taking a pill.</p>

          <p>Annabelle catches up with Jennifer before she gets into her car.</p>
          <p>“Jennifer, talk to me.”</p>
          <p>“I want to go home.”</p>
          <p>“No way you driving, I’ll drive you home.”</p>
          <p>“No chance.”</p>
          <p>Annabelle grabs her keys and they scuffle over them and Annabelle plants her on the car putting Jennifer’s hand behind her back.</p>
          <p>“Get in the car, you mad bitch.” Annabelle jokes around trying to diffuse the situation.</p>
          <p>Annabelle drives Jennifer home in her car as they head to the house, Jennifer notices Carl’s car outside which raises her spirits.</p>
          <p>“Listen I’ll be ok, my boyfriend is back.” </p>
          <p>Annabelle sees the car on the drive and lets her go, she hugs Jennifer as she leaves to go into her house.</p>
          <p>“We will talk soon, some where private, ok?” Annabelle peering out the car window.</p>
          <p>“Ok” Jennifer walking to the front door, she heads into the house to find Carl. </p>
            
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>She finds him in the dining room and is so happy to see him. She hugs and kisses him. Carl really happy to see her and feels guilty after founding out what has being going on with her, Jennifer kept this a secret from him. </p>
          <p>They both head to the sofa.</p>
          <p>“How did you know?”</p>
          <p>“Annabelle contacted me this morning, I’m so sorry, I shouldn’t have left you here on your own.” </p>
          <p>“I’m so glad to see you, I missed you so much.”</p>
          <p>“Why didn’t you tell me you were being like this, what is going on?”</p>
          <p>“I keep seeing and hearing Kiera, every time I see Annabelle, this girl I audition with. It is Kiera I am seeing, it feels like I am going through it all over again.” Jennifer is starting to get emotional.</p>
          <p>“Jeez, Kiera was because of Joey. He deserved what he got and what he did to Kiera, what he did. You have me, we need to talk this out otherwise this will end everything that is good in this relationship. This is why we are on a break now.”</p>
          <p>“It’s all crumbling apart, I can’t be able to control it.”</p>
          <p>“Do you remember what he was?”</p>
          <p>“Course I do.” Jennifer starts to raise a smile. </p>
          <p>“That’s all the motivation you need.”</p>
          <p>“Ok.”</p>
          <p>They continued to talk throughout the night and spent a night in bed together for the first time in a long time since they moved here. They were like a new couple are blissfully happy again. Jennifer feels now in a better place but still needs to resolves things with Annabelle and explains about Kiera.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A couple of days later Jennifer is with Annabelle in a café off Oxford Street where they went shopping earlier. They are sitting in the café having their drinks; Annabelle having a Carmel latte and Jennifer having an Espresso.</p>
          <p>“The director wants to know what is going on with you, as do I quite frankly?”</p>
          <p>“Alright, the play isn’t the reason me and Carl came here, back in the States something happened to us both which meant…well we need a fresh start. We had lost someone dear to us, my best friend and his sister Kiera.”</p>
          <p>“Dead?”</p>
          <p>“Yep, and whenever I see you I see her.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, ok, what all the time, she aint here right now is she?”</p>
          <p>“No, just the fact I had bottled this up and felt guilty.”</p>
          <p>“How?”</p>
          <p>“I…. well she died in a car accident…I just kinda feel that I could have done something…I don’t know.”</p>
          <p>“That’s natural, bottling it is the worst thing to do…. trust me.”</p>
          <p>“Why do you say that?”</p>
          <p>“My mum, 17, vengeful teenager rebellious, but talking about it does eased the pain…you know.”</p>
          <p>“Sorry, what happened to you to get to modelling?”</p>
          <p>“I went into a hostel, my dad remarried and forgot he had a daughter, did odd jobs and then spotting a man who liked the look of me. I started doing a little glamour but quickly went to do more professional work.”</p>
          <p>“Glamour? ……At 17?” Jennifer not believing what she is hearing.</p>
          <p>Annabelle giggles “No, 19.”</p>
          <p>“Yeah seems like all of us started with modelling, so come let talk boyfriends…. well more like yours?”</p>
          <p>“There’s nothing really.”</p>
          <p>“That’s all I get from you, come on what you hiding?”</p>
          <p>“It’s well complicated.”</p>
          <p>“Right?” Jennifer is waiting for the rest of the story.</p>
          <p>“I met him during the first week of rehearsals, we went out for drinks and some meals out, really nice guy and cute.”</p>
          <p>“Of course, slept with him yet?”</p>
          <p>“No! we haven’t really done anything, not really that involved like I said there is complication.”</p>
          <p>“His wife?”</p>
          <p>“No…. more like an agent.”</p>
          <p>“You kidding, you and your agent? Bad idea.”</p>
          <p>“Like I said we haven’t done anything we not really going out like that, he is one with all the moves and the chitchat.”</p>
          <p>“What kind of an agent is he?”</p>
          <p>“He says he specialises in working with singers/entertainers and put them into the theatre.”</p>
          <p>“Ok”</p>
          <p>A text message comes through on Jennifer’s’ phone, she looks at it saying “I want you here ASAP, need to discuss last night.” The text was from the director, Jennifer blows through her cheeks “The dragon wants me, gotta go.”
          <p>“I’ll come too, need to see some technicians about the songs.”</p>
          <p>“Oh yeah, my standards seem to have drop a little bit lately.”</p>
          <p>Annabelle getting up ready to leave and follows Jennifer out of the café.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>As they walked back to the theatre chatting away without a care in the world, James is waiting at the front of the building. Annabelle looks on a little embarrassed after the conversation in the cafe; it could be an awkward moment as Jennifer sees him with a grin on her face nudging Annabelle, as they get closer to the theatre.</p>
          <p>“Hi James!” Jennifer raising her voice joking around.</p>
          <p>“Stop it.” Annabelle is nudging Jennifer back. “Hi James.”</p>
          <p>“There’s my girl, can I speak in private.”</p>
          <p>“Of course, I’ll leave you guys.” Jennifer is heading to the entrance.</p>
          <p>“Actually Jennifer its you I want to speak to.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, ok.”</p>
          <p>“I’ll leave you guys to it.” Annabelle looks surprised and heads inside.</p>
          <p>“I’m a little concerned with what’s going on here, I have heard about your slip ups lately.”</p>
          <p>“Just a hiccup.”</p>
          <p>“If there are issues you have I’m a good listener, I could help you as something that affects my client, causes me problems.”</p>
          <p>“I appreciate it but I don’t need a therapist, I can assure you, everything will run smoothly.”</p>
          <p>“Ok, I’m sorry but I had to make sure.”</p>
          <p>“No problem.”</p>
          <p>“Annabelle tells me you holding a get together after the previews.”</p>
          <p>“A get together?”</p>
          <p>“Sorry.” James smiling.</p>
          <p>“Annabelle can tell you the details, I have to go sorry, I’m going to get my ear chewed off by the director.”</p>
          <p>As Jennifer rushes into the theatre, James gets on to his phone.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Jennifer inside the theatre heads towards the stage, Annabelle is already on the stage practising her voice. In the front row sits the director, Jennifer notices her eyes point like daggers towards Jennifer, suddenly felt a cold chill. Jennifer turns to her and heads to the front row.</p>
          <p>“I don’t know what you what you were playing at… if it wasn’t for the….”</p>
          <p>“Money? The money I have invest in this venture of yours, I had a bad turn ok, I promise it won’t happen again, we done now?” Jennifer quietly says to her.</p>
          <p>“Yeah, no more fouls up because trust me, no amount of money will save you. You’ll be fined for the escapade.”</p>
          <p>Jennifer gets out of her seat and heads to the backstage area. She meets Annabelle talking and looking at rehearsal tapes.</p>
          <p>“You still in one piece.”</p>
          <p>“No claw marks, I can handle her.”</p>
          <p>They meet with the choreographer to continue practising to get Jennifer back to where she wants to be. As she practises she looks at Annabelle and doesn’t see Kiera, she raises a smile and brings her back her confidence. For the first time since she moved to London, she feels at her best and ready to perform.</p>
          <p>As they heads towards the end of the day, in rehearsal of a scene in which Kyle and Jennifer get really close. Carl is watching from one of the far rooms, not looking so comfortable seeing them together, bringing him back to the closeness of her and Joey at the club before she shot him. He sits there composed, as he knows it’s in the play.</p>
          <p>As they finish, Jennifer turns as she hears footsteps and sees Carl; She is delighted but surprised to see him. She rushes towards him and jumps up into his arms. James is in the usual place out of sight and finally sees them together and gets the connection as he watches them embrace.</p>
          <p>“Hey, what you doing here?”</p>
          <p>“Thought I wanted to see how my baby is doing.” Carl kisses her. “I have a favour to ask you.”</p>
          <p>“Aah, there it is, what is that?”</p>
          <p>“I need you and Annabelle to perform for a special event for after the show.”</p>
          <p>“The same event we are supposed to be letting my hair down.”</p>
          <p>“Just a duet and a solo number, could be good exposure especially for Annabelle.”</p>
          <p>Jennifer looks towards Annabelle who is laughing and joking with Kyle on the stage, Jennifer raises a smile and turns back to Carl and agrees to do it.</p>
          <p>“I’ll speak to Annabelle, she’ll be fine with it.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks, I have to go back to the club, I will go through the details tonight.”</p>
          <p>“Ok babe.” Jennifer kisses him and heads to the dressing room. “If you wait a little while I’ll come with you.”</p>
          <p>“How about I help you out of that dress.” Carl jokes.</p>
          <p>“Wait till tonight I’ll dress properly for you.” Jennifer heads down one of the corridor, Carl chuckles.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
           <p>As the weeks go on, the show is bringing in a lot of sold out crowds as well as the critics. Jennifer is in the zone and is happy that things are going awesome, especially when she is having a fun friendship brewing with Annabelle. The director getting more and more happy with the positive reviews, completely forgetting what Jennifer had been doing leading up to the show.</p>
          <p>Carl watches the show, loves seeing the old Jennifer back doing what she loves doing. He continues to enjoy success of his own at the club and they both are finally in the best place as a couple with successful careers.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>As Carl’s club has much more exposure than ever before as they have boosted the amount of different clientele flooding the VIP areas and the dance floor. He walks through the club while the D.J pumping the tunes as the club is packed. He watches from the top floor down at the packed house in the club.</p>
          <p>He heads in his office, a beautiful young girl in a business suit is sitting at the desk looking through some papers. Carl looks on, thinking life just getting better and better.</p>
          <p>“How’s it going Kristine?” Carl is heading towards her with a smile on his face.</p>
          <p>“You show invest in a filing system.”</p>
          <p>“I hired you which is enough brains and glamour I need.” </p>
          <p>Kristine smiles at the compliment.</p>
          <p>“There is a guy who came here earlier looking for you, he wasn’t happy at all, I told him to wait in one of the VIP areas till you came.”</p>
          <p>“In the VIP?”</p>
          <p>“He said he was an old friend, he had two massive security guys with him, I couldn’t really refuse.”</p>
          <p>“Did he threaten you?”</p>
          <p>“No, he was calm but forceful as he really wanted to see you.”</p>
          <p>“Where is he?”</p>
          <p>“Two large men filling up the booth acting like bouncers with a small bold man with a goatee in the middle of them two, you can’t miss them.”</p>
          <p>“Ok, did he say what he wanted?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>Carl heads towards the window of the office, he looks out towards the club and spots him. He recognised him and knew this was serious, while he gazes at him Kristine heads next to him; she sneakily slides a pen into his jacket pocket without Carl’s knowledge. </p>
          <p>“Cheers Kristine.” </p>
          <p>Carl leaves and goes into the main clubroom. Kristine goes to the desk and gets onto her phone and sent out a text “Dinner out.” James is sitting in a car outside in the car park; he picks up his phone after a ringtone and looks at the text message. He turns on a device that picks up an audio feed from the pen that Kristine placed in Carl’s pocket.</p>
          <p>Carl walks across by the bar, heading his way to the VIP area where the man is sitting, arms up on the back of the sofa like he was at home. He sees Carl and raises a big grin on his face as Carl stops in the booth, he stands right in front of him with a table separating the man to Carl. His security men get up and stand next to him sensing something bad may happen to the man only for the man instruct them back down.</p>
          <p>“You know, you are one hard man to get a hold of.”</p>
          <p>“Well I’m here, I said it once and will say it for last time. It doesn’t matter how many men he sends, I’m not interested in Newcastle so you can go back and tell your boss that.”</p>
          <p>“I’m not here for any previous deal, that offer expired. I’m here because one of his associates in the United States who heard of your name is very interested in meeting you.”</p>
          <p>“I’m not interested, so enjoy the free champagne.” Carl turns around to leave.</p>
          <p>“Oh trust me, you do.” </p>
          <p>Carl starts walks off.</p>
          <p>“Marciano.”</p>
          <p>Carl stops in his track realising that this just got serious, Carl doesn’t fully know what Marciano believes, so has to find out the full facts of what Marciano knows.</p>
          <p>During his time with working with Joey, they both were under the tutorage of Joey’s dad Joey Snr. It is a difficult situation for Carl because over the years of being in that family, he saw Marciano Snr as a father figure and got close with him that did cause resentment from Joey. Carl doesn’t want to face the fact that he would have to confront him over Joey’s death, even though it was Jennifer who shot him. Carl doesn’t want to get her involved with this, so he will have play his cards close to his chest. Carl turns back around and sits on the side sofa in the booth.</p>
          <p>“Is he here?”</p>
          <p>“No, he’s in Las Vegas, he wants you there, ASAP.”</p>
          <p>“Why’s he there?”</p>
          <p>“Cause he thought you were there, anyways he wanted to see the mess Joey left behind. He very interested to found out what happened to his plaza and the other businesses since Jennifer has suddenly disappeared.”</p>
          <p>“Who?”</p>
          <p>“Joey Jr’s wife.”</p>
          <p>“Never saw him with a wife.”</p>
          <p>“This was after the deal with the Rivellis that went sour because of that undercover cop snitch (Kiera).”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know, I left the family after that. I came here getting a fresh start you know, I can’t help him.”</p>
          <p>“The problem is he doesn’t asks, he tells you.”</p>
          <p>Knowing how forceful Marciano can be, and with the fact that he could steer them away him or Jennifer, he would be suspicious if he doesn’t comply, he agrees to leave for the United States. He gets a flight for the day after the show party at the club that week.</p>
          <p>Carl heads back into the office meeting with Kristine, he tells her that she can finish for the night. Kristine gets her coat and leaves, Carl sits down at his desk thinking how to best sort this problem out.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>She leaves the club and walks around to the car park; a car starts flashing its headlights. Kristine quickly heads to the car and gets in where she is greeted by James.</p>
          <p>“Well done Lucy.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks boss, what did you get?”</p>
          <p>“Carl is going to the United States for Marciano.”</p>
          <p>“We need him here in the same place with Jennifer, if he goes that will undo months of prep.”</p>
          <p>“Marciano doesn’t know Jennifer is here, so we need Snr here…”</p>
          <p>“So we can get all three.”</p>
          <p>“Exactly.”</p>
          <p>“How though?”</p>
          <p>“I have something that may bring all three here.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“Jennifer as bait.”</p>
          <p>“Ok.”</p>
          <p>“Jennifer won’t go back to the United States any time soon, she wouldn’t risk being spotted and caught, so I have to persuade Carl to bring Marciano here.” </p>
          <p>“Good luck with that.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks.”</p>
          <p>The concern is that they don’t want this to end in murder, so they continue to discuss what to do before the finale of the show. </p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>As time went on, the show went on to be a great success, the critics are showering the show with praise that meant it was all about celebration.</p>
          <p>After the show finished, Carl holds a large social event at the club in celebration of the show. There are singers, entertainers and technicians, everyone that was involved with the production of the show. Many celebrities and large crowds of the public mixed with the critics are involved with the party for press night.</p>
          <p>Carl and Jennifer are in the thick of it meeting everyone they see. Kyle and Annabelle are dancing the night away; the director is happy and is all smiles with Jennifer, as the focus of course for her is that the show is a great success.</p>
          <p>As the party is in full swing James enters the club, Lucy in already in the arms with a man in the crowd of people as his “date”. They both look around for both Jennifer and Carl, which they are not hard to find as they both head to the stage to make an announcement. After they raise a toast to the show’s success, Carl sees James clear as day; he keeps his composure, as they didn’t leave the in CIA days on the best of terms, Carl trying to cover information from James during the investigation.</p>
          <p>He whispers into Jennifer’s ear an excuse so that he leaves the club. Carl heads through the crowd to the exit the club, James already in the crowd goes on the pursuit. They head through the back street allies so James draws his gun it stops Carl in his tracks, after hearing the click of the gun and he turns around at James.</p>
          <p>“You aren’t going to shoot me James.”</p>
          <p>“Let’s go have a chat and I won’t.”</p>
          <p>James puts away his gun.</p>
          <p>“Not at the club though, we will take a drive to my place.”</p>
          <p>“We’ll take my car.”</p>
          <p>As they head back to the car and drive off, Lucy is outside to see them head off and see goes back into the club to wait for further instruction. Jennifer is on stage with Annabelle doing a double act that is driving the crowd crazy; they are enjoying themselves as much as the crowd love watching it.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Carl and James head back to Carl’s house, Carl goes into the kitchen and gets a beer out of the fridge. He hands the beer to James, he is a little hesitant knowing what to expect from Carl, being both in the same field, and they are prepared for any situation. They then head into the dining room in which Carl puts on the T.V where football is being shown on T.V.</p>
          <p>“I never understood the popularity of this.”</p>
          <p>“I know, give me the Ravens and the Dolphins any day.”</p>
          <p>“Why are you here man?”</p>
          <p>“I need to know the truth, things don’t add up.”</p>
          <p>“Ritchie tried to get Joey, that’s all I knew from what he told.”</p>
          <p>“Jennifer is involved though, something doesn’t quite add up”</p>
          <p>“Like what?”</p>
          <p>“You and Jennifer getting involved, and both here after the fire at her club.”</p>
          <p>“You know that Joey could have shot Ritchie, you know there could have been a chance that Joey could have got a shot off before he was killed.”</p>
          <p>He knew how the CIA functions so he couldn’t deny it.</p>
          <p>“I guess that he set the place alright as well did he, lets cut the crap. I know it was either you or her that set that place alight, whether it was for the money or whatever else, I don’t care. I know you are not capable of murder, you maybe a lot of things, not a killer so that leaves one person doesn’t it? Selkan was handcuffed in one of the dressing rooms; the bullets fragments from Joey’s body don’t match the gun next to Ritchie.”</p>
          <p>“Alright, since we are off the books, no audio tapes right? I shot the little prick.”</p>
          <p>“Bull, stop protecting her, you may think you love her but she isn’t all that you think she is, trust me.”</p>
          <p>“Trust you, you haven’t a clue what we been through.”</p>
          <p>Carl turns off the T.V.</p>
          <p>“Kiera was my informant Carl.”</p>
          <p>“What you say, what the.. Did you say?” </p>
          <p>“After the shooting with the Rivellis, she managed to get into contact with me, only me. She was gathering information while at the Marciano family where she was being held captive. She was my informant while she was undercover trying to save you from going into a world you couldn’t control. Did you really think she wanted to voluntary stay there unless it was for her job? She lead me to the dealings with the Vice-President.”</p>
          <p>“That was just blackmail over some porno snapshots.”</p>
          <p>“Why though?”</p>
          <p>Carl is releasing the person behind the Vice President and Marciano family. </p>
          <p>“Malena.”</p>
          <p>“Jennifer used her to get the Vice-President, Jennifer was playing both sides between the Turks and the Marciano, she has more influence in that family than anybody could every imagine.</p>
          <p>Carl starts looking perplexed.</p>
          <p>“Jennifer brought Selkan back to Joey. She was playing Joey in exchange for a cut in the money.”</p>
          <p>“Jeez.”</p>
          <p>“That isn’t the worst part.” James paused to take a minute to explain the worst part.</p>
          <p>“Jennifer set up the plan to get Kiera killed.”</p>
          <p>“Nah,nah,nah, Joey wanted to get me back for the death of his son.” Carl starts getting angry and confused.</p>
          <p>“Jennifer’s son.”</p>
          <p>“What? Can’t be, Jennifer didn’t meet Joey till after I left.”</p>
          <p>“Joey had a one night stand with her, Jennifer left with the boy, Joey then tracked her down, looked after the kid on the side and helped raise him, they only got back together not long before the captive of Kiera.”</p>
          <p>“Why Kiera? Wait of course like Joey said, payback against me.”</p>
          <p>Carl gets up off his chair and gets ready to leave with determination in his eyes, as he wants to confront Jennifer.</p>
          <p>“You can’t go and see her.”</p>
          <p>“Why the hell not? The past year has been a lie, I need to hear this from her.”</p>
          <p>“You need to tell Marciano Sr.”</p>
          <p>“Why?”</p>
          <p>“I can get them both, but I need them both here to get him out of hiding.”</p>
          <p>“Use her as bait?”</p>
          <p>“Like she used you?”</p>
          <p>Carl takes a pause not believing what he is about to do. </p>
          <p>“All this needs to stop Carl, you know that, just be that CIA kickass I remember.”</p>
          <p>“Ok, what’s the plan now?”</p>
          <p>“Head back to the club as normal, and just wait.”</p>
          <p>James gets up and heads outside to his car not before he leaves Carl an envelope that is filled with pictures of the ‘infidelity’ from Jennifer. James waits in the car for Carl, Carl gets his gun from his bedroom and fills it with bullets and puts it in his pocket.</p>
          <p>They head back to the club; Lucy is waiting in the alley as they pull up at the club, in which James drops Carl off. Lucy gets into the car with James and they drive off as Carl is walking into the club.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Carl stands at the entrance of the main floor hearing the crowd cheering, as Jennifer prepares to preform her solo act. As he slowly walks down the steps and starts to see more of the stage straight ahead of him, Jennifer pops out of the certain starting to sing. He has no expression on his face, as he sees her, dressed as Jessica rabbit. </p>
          <p>Jennifer is performing a tribute of Jessica Rabbit’s “Why don’t you do right?” just like in the club at Las Vegas, where they he first saw her. As she sees him, a smile on her face as Carl walks through the crowd, they part like the red sea. </p>
          <p>She walks towards him down the small steps to the dance floor, he grabs a chair with a slight raised smile expecting her to seduce him as she sings. She gently pushes him down to the seat and sits on top of him facing him; she gets face to face with him seductively as she does the finale of the song. He continues to keep his expression where he inside hiding away his rage.</p>
          <p>The crowd cheers as the song finishes, the crowd cheering and applauding. She kisses him and fails into his arms as she feels safe and in a good place for the first time in a long time.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The next morning, Carl is standing outside on the balcony of his house looking out at the London landscape. Jennifer is sleeping in the bed looking so peaceful; he looks back at her still conflicted, as he feels slightly responsible for the death of her son.</p>
          <p>He doesn’t know why she never confronted him about it, let alone be with him and run away with him. Maybe in his mind he feels that Jennifer wanting Kiera dead was a mistake out of rage and maybe Joey influenced her into making it a reality, he doesn’t know. So many ideas went through his head, but one thing for sure was that love overcomes everything, as Jennifer would have killed him like Joey and Ritchie by now.</p>
          <p>His relationship with Marciano Snr. is also conflicted because of the bond and the help Carl received in getting a new life despite being a corrupt one after leaving CIA, he felt wanted by the Marciano family. Nothing would erase the fact that Carl had a father figure in him but knowing how much Marciano was involved in the capture and death of Kiera, plus the fact he can’t shake the CIA philosophies out of him. He knows he has the power to stop all this and will have to take it.</p>
          <p>As he leans on the rail of the balcony, he gets out a cigarette out of the pack and lights a match. He hesitates and flicks the match away and puts the cigarette back in the pack and chucks them away. He picks up some clothes as he passes Jennifer who is still sleeping.</p>
          <p>He goes out the door and gets out his phone only to see a car with James and Lucy sitting inside. He gets towards the car where he realises what is going with her as she is smiling at him. He gets into the car and they drive off.</p>
          <p>“So how did James drag you into this Kristine or…”</p>
          <p>“Lucy.”</p>
          <p>“Shame I kinda preferred Kristine, add a bit of glamour to that work suit which I must say, complimented you very well.”</p>
          <p>“Told you Kristine was the right name.” she smiles knowing Carl’s reputation.</p>
          <p>“How long have you been in the field?”</p>
          <p>“Eighteen months.”</p>
          <p>They head to the penthouse.</p>
          <p>“So what you going to do?”</p>
          <p>“You want Jennifer and Marciano, you have them. He believes it was me, it’s a trap to bring me to the States so he can kill me.”</p>
          <p>“We better give him some reason not to.”</p>
          <p>“There is Joey’s will. Jennifer had his dad removed from any of the claim of the business, the very ones that she sold to his rivals.”</p>
          <p>“We have to see his lawyer.”</p>
          <p>“It isn’t there.”</p>
          <p>“What you mean?”</p>
          <p>“That’s the original, Jennifer has made the lawyer keep there just in case.”</p>
          <p>“The real copy and the records of the deals are in the safety deposit box at our bank. There are also names and details of her dealings she had been involved with, behind the Marciano family back and some with them, all the evidence you need to get them both.”</p>
          <p>“Always thought you couldn’t shake that CIA bug off.”</p>
          <p>“There is a problem, I need Jennifer with me to be able to access it, it’s in her name.”</p>
          <p>“Bring her, get in and Lucy will distract her as you get the information.”</p>
          <p>“Ok.”</p>
          <p>Later that day, a car pulls up outside the bank and is followed by James, both Carl and Jennifer came out of the car and head inside. Lucy is standing at one of the booths and is in a business suit in disguise. Jennifer and Carl goes towards the vault and Lucy bumps in Jennifer and they start arguing, Carl goes into the vault and gets what’s he needs.</p>
          <p>As he comes back Lucy is with security guards as Jennifer is pushed away from her. He leaves with Jennifer out the bank and drive off as the plan went off without a glitch. Carl calls Marciano Snr. to tell him that Jennifer is in London; he then emails the information off towards him to provide the proof that will bring him to London and see it was her.</p>
          <p>A couple of days later in the evening, Marciano Snr. arrives through the airport. A man heads through in the other direction and bumps into Marciano and drops an envelope. He continues on in the airport, Marciano looks down and picks up the envelope and walks out of the main doors. He heads into a taxi and heads off, while inside the taxi, he pulls out a card with Jennifer’s house details.</p>
          <p>“Where to?” The taxi driver asks, Marciano gives the driver Jennifer’s address.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>That evening at the club, Carl was at the club with Lucy. He was looking out of the window at the dance floor nervous of what is going to happen.</p>
          <p>“James is following his every move, he won’t let anything happen to Jennifer.”</p>
          <p>“The last thing I want is to do is her to be killed, I just want her to see help.”</p>
          <p>“You call her and bring her here, Marciano will follow.”</p>
          <p>He gets onto his phone and sends her a text message. Jennifer starts to leave the house after delivering the message and heads down towards her car; James looks on in the car. Suddenly a gunshot is sounded, James ducks as a bullet hits his window screen. Suddenly out of nowhere, Marciano drags Jennifer into his car and they drive off. James quickly gets into his car and follows; he knows where Marciano is planning to go the club to the club.</p>
          <p>At the club itself, Annabelle was on stage performing to the crowd enjoying the night away. She was in a duet with an upcoming rapper where the club continues to draw large crowds. On a back of the theatre success Annabelle was rising as a star, Carl watches on at Annabelle, he sees a bit of Jennifer in her and it was making this more difficult as he sees the light fun side of Jennifer. He sees why he fell for Jennifer and has to block that out in order to do the right thing.</p>
          <p>Lucy looking at him looking a little concerned seeing what sort of state Carl could be in.</p>
          <p>“You don’t have to be here when we arrest them.”</p>
          <p>“I need to do it, I need to face her.”</p>
          <p>Towards the end of the night, Marciano waits in the car with Jennifer. She is trying to convince him that Ritchie was the one, but Marciano wasn’t having any of it.</p>
          <p>As the club is closing, people are leaving which prompts Marciano to get ready. Annabelle goes to meet Carl after she finishes, Carl rushes her out so she will be out of harms way.</p>
          <p>Annabelle with some of the staff leaves the place, Carl heads to the dance floor while Lucy stays in the office. In the club Jennifer turns up as Carl is in the main dance floor waiting, she is looking scared and a gun pointed at her back as Marciano walks in behind. Both of them head into the centre of the oval dance floor.</p>
          <p>“Thanks Carl, loyalty is important to me, which is just as important as vengeance.”</p>
          <p>Jennifer turns to Carl in shock and upset as she is feeling betrayed.</p>
          <p>“You son of a ……”</p>
          <p>“I had to, I know everything Jennifer, all about Kiera and your son.”</p>
          <p>“It took me a long time to forgive, I love you too much and I became so close to Kiera that I couldn’t go through with it.”</p>
          <p>“Liar.” Carl says in a calm tone.</p>
          <p>“Why do you think I wasn’t there?”</p>
          <p>Carl was thinking and knowing that Joey could have pushed her.</p>
          <p>“Believe what you want Carl, but this new life should be enough.”</p>
          <p>“I have no choice now, it’s all over Jennifer.”</p>
          <p>“What now Carl, you just going to let him kill me?”</p>
          <p>“That’s right Jennifer, please do me a favour now Jennifer, go and stand next to Carl.”</p>
          <p>Marciano is still pointing the gun at Jennifer, as she goes and stands next to Carl. Carl seeing that it will be over as Marciano looks to kill the both of them. </p>
          <p>“Shame it had to end like this Carl, I always wanted more boys, but you two killed my only son, so as much as it hurts me, times up.”</p>
          <p>He gets ready to fire, only for Lucy to shoot off a gunshot out of the office. She then comes out of the office shouting out “freeze”. Marciano shoots towards the window of the office in which gave Carl the chance to tackle him to the ground and scuffle over the gun.</p>
          <p>Jennifer grabs a gun and points it at them both, confused on what to do. Carl and Marciano look at her; Carl tries to reason with her only for Marciano to knock Carl down.</p>
          <p>Marciano tries to escape through the front door only to hear sirens as many police cars including James pull up outside of the front of the club. Multiple guns from the police point at him, Lucy comes through and Marciano grabs her and holds her at gunpoint. A sniper from the top shoots him in the shoulder that drops him; Marciano is then arrested and taken away.</p>
          <p>Jennifer heads to the back rooms where the toilets are, to escape, Carl goes on the chase. The police storm into the club and search around, James comes towards Lucy wanting to know where Jennifer and Carl are.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Carl searches the toilets, he hears Jennifer going through of the window of another toilet, and so he goes into the female toilets and goes through the window after her. She rushes through the alleyway and rushes out onto the road looking for a car to hijack.</p>
          <p>Carl calls her trying to get her to stop; she stops and turns around towards Carl upset. Suddenly beaming lights shine towards the side of Jennifer’s face, the sound of the beeping horn turns Jennifer and a car hits her over.</p>
          <p>Carl rushes down to her to check over her, she is shaking with blood dripping off her head to her face. He is scared and is joined by the driver who starts to dial for an ambulance. She looks up at Carl not able to speak and frightened as Carl tries to console her and starts to panics as he tries to stop the blood.</p>
          <p>“It’s ok, it’s ok, you will be going to be fine, you not going to die, the ambulance is on the way.”</p>
          <p>She continues to look at him still shaking. Carl starts to get emotional saying to himself “Oh god, stay with me.” She says very gently barely getting a sound out of her mouth as she says, “I love you, I’m sorry.”</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>At the hospital, Carl sits in one of the seats in the waiting room head down. Flashes go through his head of the doctors trying to save Jennifer only for the dreaded long line shoots across the machine and that long beep as they couldn’t save Jennifer’s life.</p>
          <p>James walks through as Carl sits up, with no expression on his face as he deals with a mixture of anger and despair. James goes to sit next to him and takes a quick breath knowing what he has to do, but finds difficult to do.</p>
          <p>“You know what has to happen now.”</p>
          <p>Carl now resigned to his fate not really caring what happens as his world as falling around from under him, as James places a pair of handcuffs on his lap.</p>
          <p>Both Jennifer and Carl walk out of the hospital, Carl with his hand placed together by those handcuffs, he knew that he would not be the shining warrior, or the lone cowboy riding off in the sunset, but accepts his fate.</p>
          <p>As time went on Carl was placed in custody, he was set to trial where despite not committing the murders was sentenced to initially ten years. As the case went on though prior to the trial, Carl had worked with James to bring down the Marciano family empire and provided all the information that he needed which reduces his sentence. </p>
          <p>At the trial James and a line of high profile officers in the LAPD and CIA had given testimonials on his behalf as Carl despite his faults was well respected and loved. He was sent into protective custody for five years. </p>
          <p>Carl at first was trying to be strong at first but had no choice as being an ex cop is open season for any murders, rapists, thieves, not to mention the fact that men tend to get exited at fresh meat in prison. Carl over time had managed to build himself up but still struggled without Jennifer. He even at one point tried to commit suicide by hanging himself. </p>
          <p>But he did persevere when he realised that when that attempt didn’t work, they after some therapy that he could start over and when he served his time, he had decided to join with James unofficially as a consultant or more like a sleuth. He started gaining respect again from the very place that he was disgraced from as the cases got solved one by one.</p>
          <p>One day he was working for the main streets of New York, he notices Annabelle across the street, she doesn’t see him, and she heads up some small stairs into a building. On the top is a advertisement for the show ‘Guys and Dolls’ being shown on Broadway.</p>
          <p>Carl raises a smile and continues down the street.</p>
