        <h3>Part I</h3>
        <p>
          One dark steamy night, a figure appears through the headlamps, Carl in
          a trench coat walking to an apartment complex lighting a cigarette.
        </p>
        <p>
          He heads to the front of that apartment building only to be greeted by
          a woman. A dress that goes far above her knees, her hand planted on
          the wall to hold her staggered body off the wall. He lifts his head
          and as he sees her, a grin rises on his face as he walks closer and
          closer towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Where you been baby? I’ve been waiting all night for you.” She slurs
          excitedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Not waiting alone I see.” as he smells, the cheap liquor off her
          breath. He takes her inside the complex and escorts her by the stairs
          to the central door of 3 apartments on the 2nd floor. As she is
          carried across the hall, her hands roaming in his coat pocket looking
          for something.
        </p>
        <p>“Did you see him and get it?” She slurs.</p>
        <p>
          “Yeah babe, 4 grams, now stop talking and get that dress off.” He
          replies as he rushes her to his bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Rough and direct, I like that.” She says giggling drunk as he slams
          his apartment door.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next night, Carl walks down a street filled with pubs, shops and
          clubs. He comes heads to an entrance of an underground club that isn’t
          clear to view on the outside, but the sounds of cheering, shouting of
          excitement of the drunk customers gives it the atmosphere of a club.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a club he visits every night to fill the void of a not being
          able to get the image of Kiera’s lifeless body out of his mind. As he
          heads down the stairs, there is a sound of a woman singing the song
          from Caro Emerald called “That man.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He enters the main room where the room that has round tables, a side
          bar filled with drooling drunk men with their wives, girlfriends and
          even the few with their mistresses all have a good time. Carl stops in
          the centre at the back of the room and stops a passing waitress and
          calls for a shot of bourbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You got it Carl.” As she gives him a smile, a cheeky one that would
          indicate it wasn’t the pure waitress customer interaction but more of
          a more of an interaction like he had with the woman last night, a
          means to an end. In his world now, he makes delusional promises to
          women stardom, using his charm but doesn’t deliver on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he takes a sip of his drink, he looks straight forward to have a
          clear of the woman on stage, as she performs, her head raises up to
          Carl. As she is singing and glaring at him, she continues to sing with
          passion full of lust in her eyes. Her voice was very much like Amy
          Winehouse, a voice that could tell you a story that could never end, a
          book that Carl could not put down. Her eyes are dark and mysterious
          but also troubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the song comes to an end, she disappears into the darkness as the
          spotlight fades; the club then erupts with applause. Carl heads
          towards the woman’s dressing room with the name “Malena” on a star on
          the door. As he enters the door, he is greeted by a passionate kiss by
          her, so delighted to see him.
        </p>
        <p>“I missed you, where were you this morning?”</p>
        <p>
          “I had an acquaintance I was meeting.” hiding the fact he was getting
          rid of the girl he was dealing drugs to last night.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So what did the director say…I got the lead didn’t I…I knew you would
          come through…finally a ticket out this dump…. I always…”
        </p>
        <p>“Did you see him?” as he stops her in mid sentence.</p>
        <p>“Who?”</p>
        <p>“You know who?”</p>
        <p>
          Her smile goes away as she goes to sit down opposite her mirror. “No
          just one of his minions, he will only come when the deals is to
          completed, he needs to sell these goods first?”
        </p>
        <p>“Do you know what the goods are?”</p>
        <p>“No he is tight lipped, so…”</p>
        <p>“You got a date and time?”</p>
        <p>
          “Wednesday night, so what did she say?” with an impatient tone in her
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>“I’m sorry babe, they wanted someone else.”</p>
        <p>
          “What? You said it was a done deal? Why do I bother with you
          seriously?"
        </p>
        <p>“I need a drink anyway.” As he leaves and head towards the bar.</p>
        <p>
          He orders another drink while sitting at the bar, his back facing the
          stage. As the barman pours the scotch, the lights starts to dimmer
          that transforms the stage to be black as night, only a single
          spotlight reveals the main event of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scent a sweet familiar singing voice attracts the attention of
          Carl. He turns towards a beauty on the stage, he comes to see her but
          because she intrigues him as they haven’t spoken to her, compared to
          the other female staff that work in the club. There is something that
          attracts him to her; he can’t understand what it is. Usually he meets
          these girls, over keen and a bit naïve. He has been at the club when
          she has performed and seen her for the last couple of months and she
          has a confidence of independence, which he is wondering whey would she
          be working in a run down club for chump change.
        </p>
        <p>
          She performs her music with the band of sweet slow jazzy tunes. She
          sings the song called “Mean O’ Moon.” By Norah Jones. As she raises
          her head, her red rosy lips to the microphone and a sweet smile that
          mesmerises all the men in the club. As Carl watches her with a smile
          on his face, unaware that through the shutters of her dressing room is
          Malena looking on at the woman, green with envy and seeing Carl
          looking at her, knowing that she is a threat to her. As much as Malena
          hates him, love and hate intertwine.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the song draws to a close, she sits down on the chair to do the
          closing of the song. This gave an opportunity for a man at the front
          to get over excited while stinking drunk, he tries to be over friendly
          with the long leg of the beauty, as her legs are folded sitting on the
          chair. His reward was a right hook from her and was dragged out of the
          door by Carl, chucking him out of the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Some people don’t think to buy a lady a drink first.” Carl says as he
          returns to her.
        </p>
        <p>“You offering?” she replying flustered.</p>
        <p>“As along as I can kept my face in mint condition.”</p>
        <p>
          She smiles at him “I needed something after singing all night, white
          wine.” She calls to the barman.
        </p>
        <p>
          They continue to chat as the club closes for the night. Malena comes
          out of her dressing room, sees them and looking a little bit annoyed.
          As she passes her she hugs her and says goodbye, she continues out of
          the club ignoring Carl. Carl looks towards Malena as she leaves not
          surprised by her attitude.
        </p>
        <p>“Is it something you said?” she wonders.</p>
        <p>“Long story, so is there a name to that singing voice?”</p>
        <p>“Jennifer.” as she smiles.</p>
        <p>
          “Jennifer, I have seen you here perform, its only now that I have been
          able to talk to you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Lucky you, I’ve only worked this late recently, you don’t want an
          autograph do you?” she says with a little bit of sarcasm, quick
          witted.
        </p>
        <p>“Ill take a number.”</p>
        <p>
          “You don’t waste time.” as she chuckles. “Drink first.” She sips down
          some wine.
        </p>
        <p>“For the right girl, so have did you end up in this place?”</p>
        <p>
          “I just came here to Nirvanna about six months ago, got stopped in the
          street by this guy, said I could do some modelling, while I was doing
          that the photographers’ cousin owned this place, found that I can sing
          and could got my work here, saw me, hired me on the spot and here I
          am.”
        </p>
        <p>
          They continued to chat as they left the club, they were laughing and
          joking as they head down the streets covered in lighted headlamps. As
          they head through one of the side streets, a robber holds a gun at
          them confronts them. Jennifer is terrified, Carl looks at him deadpan
          and disarms him in one swoop and holds him to the ground. He plants
          his knee into the back of the robber’s neck, as the robber is face
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That way of life will only end one-way, the morgue. I would consider
          my career options.” as he is face to face with the robber. The robber
          runs off as fast and as far as his legs can take him.
        </p>
        <p>“You a cop or something?” Jennifer says after composing herself.</p>
        <p>“Was.” He replies.</p>
        <p>
          They head to his apartment, despite knowing about his connection with
          Hollywood and getting to know his charm, she wasn’t convinced could
          she his intentions.
        </p>
        <p>“Want to come in for a night cap?”</p>
        <p>
          “Do you know what, Ill take a rain check, maybe further down the
          line.” as she walks off and down the stairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl looks at her not really looking disheartened, he has a smile on
          his face as he goes into his apartment, knowing she isn’t as easy as
          the others.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next morning Jennifer leaves her house, it is an important day for
          her as she is an inspiring performer. That particular week she had the
          3rd audition week that is the typical life for performer who wants to
          get into the bright lights of show business. Having a pretty face can
          get you into places, but a sweet voice and legs to match, a strong
          personality does sometimes help.
        </p>
        <p>
          She heads into the hallway that seems to run forever. The corridor is
          long and filled with two rows of chairs opposite each other, filled
          with girls doing their make up, reading scripts and rehearsing lines,
          practicing their voices. They will do anything to get an edge on the
          girls they are competing against.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she sits in the seat quiet as a mouse eyes closed, time moves on as
          she waits to be called in. Her eyes open and are drawn more and more
          focused as she gets closer and closer to the main door waiting for her
          audition.
        </p>
        <p>“Then a voice came from nowhere.</p>
        <p>
          “Had fun last night?” As Malena walks pass her, and sits in the seat
          opposite her.
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah, seems like a sweet guy.” she replies.</p>
        <p>
          “Not bad in the sack either.” “You know that he has a type right?”
        </p>
        <p>“I heard, gullible and ambitious.”</p>
        <p>
          She looks at what she says knowing no malicious behind it. “Envy is
          very bad for you, it ages you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Malena and Jennifer have a playful friendship, they have a competitive
          streak both being performers. Malena sees them as being close, but she
          sees it more of keeping your friends close, your rivals even closer.
          But she does care for Jennifer in her own way. Jennifer likes to see
          the good in people and sees that Malena is troubled than being a bad
          person, which is true.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they continue to sit, the door opens and a tall redhead secretary
          with a clipboard calls in Malena in next. As she heads into the room
          ready for audition while having a confident smile on her face she says
          just before she enters the room;
        </p>
        <p>“Be careful of him, he has many strings to her bow.”</p>
        <p>“If you want him, I won’t get in the way, he’s too brawny.”</p>
        <p>She giggles, “ Ready for the duet tonight?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah”</p>
        <p>From the smile, Malena turns focus trying to save face.</p>
        <p>
          “Don’t wear my shoes, I know you have been eying them up. This is a
          big earner tonight so don’t let the side down.” as she goes into the
          audition room. Jennifer smiles.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Later that evening, the lights of the Las Vegas strip cover in the
          night sky. Malena travels into the multi lighted streets across to a
          large hotel Plaza in the backseat of a car. Malena is escorted out of
          her car; it drives off behind her as she takes a breath as she looks
          up at the Plaza, which was a tall as the Effiel tower. She enters the
          high gold entrance doors of the Plaza and struts down the lobby like a
          model walking down a catwalk. She takes the elevator to the top floor
          and heads to a door that has two men on each side guarding the door
          suited up like they were like bouncers.
        </p>
        <p>“Is Joey in?” she says with an impatient look on her face.</p>
        <p>“He is not seeing anyone right now,” says the left bouncer.</p>
        <p>“Joey, its Malena!” she shouts out.</p>
        <p>
          “Let her in boys.” Joey’s voice comes through on the speaker placed
          through the wall.
        </p>
        <p>“I missed you, where were you this morning?”</p>
        <p>
          “I had an acquaintance I was meeting.” Malena enters the large room.
          There is artwork on the walls, there was an exaggerated piece of him
          as a muscular emperor in a coliseum, and he has two dragons grasped in
          each of his hands showing that he sees himself as a hero and a
          warrior, typical spoilt rich kid with a vivid imagination. He does
          work out and is a pretty boy but he is no hero and nothing like a
          warrior. The room does portray any self centred, indulged millionaire.
          His face turns to delight at the sight of Malena wearing a Shining
          Embellished Cocktail Dress by Shail that show off her slender legs
          that go all the way down to her five inch Bilenemacia high heels.
        </p>
        <p>“Malena! How come you haven’t being returning my calls?”</p>
        <p>
          “I have been busy you know, singing, auditions, sleeping with certain
          politians.” as she circles the room. “All in a days work to be a
          success in this world, isn’t that what you told me Joey?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “That’s a little harsh Malena.” he gets up, walks towards her and gets
          a little touchy feely with her. “I don’t make you do it everyday.” As
          she turns to him face-to-face then puts her face down and exhales.
          Joey smiles and holds her head up, by placing his hand underneath her
          chin.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Cheer up, you only need to run my new business venture and your
          scrounging days are over.”
        </p>
        <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
        <p>
          “My new business venture with our friend Westwood, the lovely
          politian, your close companion.”
        </p>
        <p>“What you need with him?”</p>
        <p>
          “Well you little love affair has given me a lovely opportunity of a
          cash injection, you know so the wife doesn’t find out that he has been
          a very naughty boy.”
        </p>
        <p>“Blackmail.”</p>
        <p>
          “Dirty word that.” as he goes back to the desk and heads into the draw
          and takes out an A4 brown envelope that he places on the table by
          Malena.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It would be nice to run my own business, what is it? A fashion
          boutique, a salon or is it one of your type of businesses?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “To be honest Malena, those kinds of businesses you mention don’t give
          me the money I need, but you’re on the right tracks as it involves
          girls living up to a certain potential…”

        <p>
          “A club? No more like a brothel, you can forget it.” as she starts to
          leave.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You want to bet on that.” Joey says to stop Malena in her tracks
          playing with a deck of cards. “Come on Malena, I need the club at the
          front of this operation and you are perfect. I need that distraction
          and base so I can do my other sweet little business dealings.” He
          means his money laundering and drug dealings, I guarantee you it is
          only till I raise the capital.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She holds the door looks up and slams it in front of her and turns to
          Joey and walks to the desk. “Since daddy cut you off.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “How about one hand of blackjack?” She sits next to the deck of cards
          on the table.
        </p>
        <p>“You never fail to surprise, what are the terms?”</p>
        <p>
          “I win I’m out, you finance me out of here.” “You win, I’m yours.”
        </p>
        <p>“Mind, body and soul?”</p>
        <p>
          “You have been desiring it for so long, here’s your opportunity for a
          night with me.”
        </p>
        <p>“You on.” Joey grins.</p>
        <p>
          Joey shuffles a deck of cards and places two cards down on the table
          in front of Malena to show her hand, he turns one over to reveal the
          nine of clubs. On his hand he has the nine of hearts. He reveals the
          ten of diamonds in which she sticks for a score of nineteen.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend.” as she sits locking her fingers
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turns the card to reveal the king of spades. “House always wins,
          for I am the king.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Malena loses her smile and picks up the envelope and heads to the
          door.
        </p>
        <p>“Why Westwood?”</p>
        <p>
          “People in the higher nonchalant can open I lot of doors to mystical
          worlds these days, acquiring properties, licenses, planning
          permission. Anything you want to make it in this world, except money.
          Well until now.” “You want out, I’m fair, here is your is your get of
          jail free card. I propose this; you send this envelope to Westwood
          when you meet him next. Tell him to bring the money to the meet I have
          arranged for him. You do this the brothel will be yours to own by
          name, do little dealings with it just to make appearances from time to
          time. You can have your life back in part and I will set you up
          financially and enjoy your life with our friend Carl.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She looks at him knowing he was joking, as she knows Joey hates Carl.
          “Does Carl know about the details of the meet?” Joey inquires.
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah, You not going to hurt him, are you?”</p>
        <p>
          “Course not, me and him used to work together, just need to get over
          this little patch and resolve things like men.” Joey smiling.
        </p>
        <p>
          She leaves carrying the envelope in her purse. She heads back down and
          heads towards the exit only to stop and gets distracted by the slot
          machines. She heads back down the corridor. Joey goes down to the
          bottom floor, moves towards the casino and stands at the entrance with
          his hands in his pockets. He does look at little concerned, as he
          needs deal far more than his vasard tells anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has an air of confidence, which he uses for cover as he is like any
          rich powerful man has heat on him from the law and with his hefty
          lifestyle needs to be funded.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father lives in Spain after leaving him the wealth from his
          retirement. Malena is an unstable asset for him who uses cards, slot
          machines and roulette tables as a solution to an itch that all
          gamblers have, but what she lacks in being vulnerable, she makes up in
          determination.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next morning in a café diner on the corner of the street, Carl and
          an old partner from the LAPD are sitting in the diner.
        </p>
        <p>
          His name is Ritchie, he is a bit of a joker, but good at his job,
          unlike Carl who let his career slip after Kiera’s incident. Carl was
          let loose after a mental break down where he has been on Joey’s trail
          ever since working alongside Ritchie.
        </p>
        <p>“So, what do you want to tell me?” Richie asks.</p>
        <p>“What you talking about?”</p>
        <p>
          Ritchie chuckles “You don’t call first thing if it wasn’t important.”
        </p>
        <p>“I need something, a favour.”</p>
        <p>“I guessed that, who you after?”</p>
        <p>
          The waitress places two black coffees to the table. Ritchie looks at
          her with a smile on his face.
        </p>
        <p>“Thanks, does a phone number come with that?”</p>
        <p>“Funny Richie.” as the waitress walks off.</p>
        <p>“Give it a rest man, she wont budge.” Carl suggests.</p>
        <p>“You wont succeed without trying.” Ritchie responds.</p>
        <p>
          They start to drink their coffees and after Carl takes a sip of his,
          he says the name. “Joey Marciano.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jeez, you know we been chasing him, we have his plaza on
          surveillance, checking his accounts, all clean so my boss is calling
          to drop it.” “Politics is a dangerous game, just like the one Malena
          is playing.”
        </p>
        <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>
          “Last week while we were tailing some of his men, a tip off, from a
          source found them while watching outside Vice President Westwood’s
          house. He was getting into a car with Malena in which we tailed them
          to a motel off the outskirts of Nirvana.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “What the hell has she got herself into? She was being acting weird
          lately, even weirder than usual.” “What I need is some Intel on Joeys’
          recent movements from the past month, there is something going on with
          Westwood and Joey with Malena in the middle. I presume he is the
          contact that will meet Joey.”
        </p>
        <p>“What meet? When and where are they having it?”</p>
        <p>“Tomorrow evening.”</p>
        <p>“Ill set up a team.”</p>
        <p>
          “No, No police, this is small piece of a puzzle I presume, you’ll
          spook Joey and we will have nothing.” Carl tells Ritchie.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Your right, he is being tight lipped, could be lots more of them.”
        </p>
        <p>“I just need you and a gun.”</p>
        <p>
          “You know you aren’t Rambo right, you can’t go in all guns blazing…
          alright I’m arresting him when the time is right when we have enough
          on him.”
        </p>
        <p>“Ok, bring the gun to me tonight.”</p>
        <p>
          Ritchie looks around while agreeing with him, only to have his eye
          caught by some clicking on the pavement. As Carl looked on, he
          couldn’t believe his eyes, as it was the sight of Jennifer from the
          club. But she isn’t the Jessica rabbit style he was used to seeing at
          night, but in a T-shirt and jeans with a cap covering her ponytail.
          She was reading the newspaper with her thick black glasses. She
          stopped by the sight of Carl staring at her; she raises a smile and
          continues walking down the street.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl and Ritchie look back at each other, Ritchie starts to shake his
          head and smile. Ritchie knows Carl smitten with the ladies.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen to me, when you see Joey, keep your cop head on and don’t let
          your emotions controls this situation.”
        </p>
        <p>“I wondered when you were going to mention Kiera.”</p>
        <p>“Killing Joey won’t bring your sister back.”</p>
        <p>
          “I rather see him rot watching as he grabs the soap, the gun is for
          protection, she died trying to straighten me out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When Carl went rogue, Kiera went undercover earning Joey’s trust as a
          supplier trying to persuade Carl away from the Marciano family.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have breakfast; Carl has a full English will Ritchie have
          pancakes while he continues to check out the waitress. He wondering
          about the plain girl who walked past, as it isn’t usually the type
          Carl goes for.
        </p>
        <p>“Who was the girl?”</p>
        <p>
          “Someone I met in the club but watched perform for the last couple of
          months. Her name is Jennifer, trust me if you had seen her perform,
          god damn.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As Ritchie gets up and is ready to leave, he leaves Carl with these
          words.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Don’t let Joey control your emotions with Jennifer, if he finds out
          her, well she shouldn’t be involved in your crazy world.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I know what I’m doing.” as Carl gets up and they both leave the
          diner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          That evening, the thundering rain covered the night sky, Carl heads
          down the same lighted street with an umbrella covering him as he
          lights a cigarette. He enters the club and stops the waitress walking
          past, it isn’t the same waitress from the previous night before, but
          she also gives him a cheeky smile just like the waitress last night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like in many clubs, there are waitresses/singers/bar staff that
          want to take that next step into success in entertainment world. The
          alternant goal for them is for them to go through the door of success
          and stroll down the Hollywood walk of fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl happens to be the lucky smock that knows all the right people who
          loves to mix business with pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has a pint of Carlsberg in his hand; straight ahead of him are both
          Malena and Jennifer doing a duet on the stage. Malena and Jennifer’s
          friendship over the couple of months is a love/hate one as they came
          to be best friends, but with Malena’s envy and some cases of paranoia
          when it comes to fame and men, it somewhat makes her hate Jennifer
          from time to time. It doesn’t make sense as they are both are
          intelligent, beautiful and ambitious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only other explanation could be their upbringings, which could
          lead to their choices in life. They both had standard upbringings, but
          when Jennifer was about 13, her parents had split and they left her
          with her grandmother in Boston.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malena didn’t really have a problem growing up, her problems came
          later on as she was trying to pursue her dream of fame and find her
          identity at her teenage years. She wasn’t really the popular one at
          university, she was the girl that always was writing and sketching in
          her diary but saw fame was more appealing and simpler. Her recent
          lifestyle choices and actions in fame go on parallel with Marilyn
          Monroe, meeting the wrong people and filed with insecurities in
          perusing fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girls were singing in sweet harmony as they perform the duet in
          the main event of the evening, it was a rare treat for the paying
          customers, as they loved the both of them. Both girls are all smiles,
          moving hips to the jazzy beats from the band playing behind them with
          a piano they both were sitting on. They reach the end of the song,
          Jennifer performing to the crowd, Malena though can’t keep her eyes
          off Carl straight ahead of her, they finish, they are to a standing
          ovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a waitress comes over to microphone to announce that Jennifer will
          be doing a special encore, the crowd are excited by that news. Carl
          leaves the bar, as Jennifer is preparing to preform in her dressing
          room, Malena is in hers. He heads to the two dressing rooms that next
          to each other, Malena’s on the left and Jennifer’s on the right. He
          isn’t sure which to choose, he wants to see Jennifer but instead goes
          into Malena’s for the business of Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he enters the room, Malena engulfs him, as she wants to keep Carl
          sweet for the plan of luring him to the meet, but she has strong
          feelings for him and is somewhat conflicted. But Carl has one thing in
          mind; he wants only the information in order to understand what Joey
          is up to. He resists her advances and wants to know the details for
          the meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why is Joey meeting someone?” as he takes Malena’s hands off her
          chest. She heads back down to her chair and looks through her mirror.
        </p>
        <p>”He is looking at expansion.”</p>
        <p>“Does he know I’m here?”</p>
        <p>
          “No, just do what you need to do with him, whatever that is ok, I have
          given all I know.” oblivious to the chequered past Joey and Carl have.
        </p>
        <p>He sits down next to her trying to reconcile with her.</p>
        <p>
          “I know about you and Westwood ok, I know this is dangerous, Joey can
          lead you into a web with this guy that you wont be able to get out
          of.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am a big girl, school of hard knocks. Listen this something that is
          out of your depth.” trying to save face not trying to tell Carl the
          predicament she is in.
        </p>
        <p>“Nothing is out of my depth when it comes to Joey Marcelano.”</p>
        <p>“Turks.” She blurted out.</p>
        <p>“Jeez, what have they got to do with it?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know but as far as I know it isn’t to do with Westwood.”</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t really, sounds too far fetched.”</p>
        <p>
          “Ok, so what is going on with you? What has Joey got on you for you to
          do this?“
        </p>
        <p>
          He tries to get her to open up with what is going on with Westwood and
          the predicament with Joey. All Carl knows is that she heard of Joey by
          working at his casino and hears say about his dealings, which she is
          lying about. Carl recently found out about the affair with Westwood
          but doesn’t understand that connection.
        </p>
        <p>“I don’t know your talking about.”</p>
        <p>
          “The changes in attitude, the wild spending, you can’t be earning that
          much and I’m sure Westwood isn’t funding you.” “Having some new
          threads, jewellery and that new set of wheels I have seen you in.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “A girl can’t treat herself once in a while.” as she starts to break
          down as she gets up and looks outside. “I can’t do this anymore, I
          don’t work for Joey, I do but as an informant so to speak. As she
          turns back at him up.”
        </p>
        <p>“What does he have on you?”</p>
        <p>
          “Nothing, but doing cards, roulettes can suck you in and in a blink,
          you are facing a debt to a greedy, sleazy, manipulation from a silver
          spoon dick.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen, you should leave this place, I can ransack Joey of some of
          his wealth from the casino with your help and you can be set up for a
          new life, even a chance to go Hollywood, whatever you want.“
        </p>
        <p>“With you?” she replies with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>“Me and you don’t work.”</p>
        <p>“Because Jennifer isn’t…”</p>
        <p>“Oh come on.” as he gets up annoyed but knowing that is the case.</p>
        <p>
          “No wait…you don’t fall in love, isn’t that what you said, you don’t
          want to show weakness do you, just cause she got a pretty face, a
          range of curves that any man would like to place a dollar bill to.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “This jealousy is getting the best of you, you need to get these ideas
          out of your head, you need to get sorted with Joey and find someone
          right for you, you and me trying to ride of into the sunset isn’t
          going to end well.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t believe in fairy tales, you don’t think I’m oblivious to you,
          waitresses talk, how many of these Hollywood wannabes have you
          promised eh?”
        </p>
        <p>“Jeez just leave it.”</p>
        <p>
          “I know why you do it, you coming in every night like the other
          drunks, you trying to fill the void, in your case the loss?”
        </p>
        <p>
          He snaps and picks her up and plants her on the wall and kisses her
          hard. Malena not in fear or pain, she was more excited than anything
          to see the passion in his eyes. As they cool down and she out of
          character says “Don’t come to the meet, just leave this place.”
        </p>
        <p>“Don’t ever mention Kiera.”</p>
        <p>
          He leaves the room; Malena remains placed on the wall and continues to
          stare at the wall breathing heavily. As Carl enters into the main
          room, the clubs was closing for the evening as the remaining drunks by
          being escorted out by the remaining waitress.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jennifer is on the stage sorting her bag, the waitress says goodbye
          to her and leaves. Malena walks out of the dressing room, tries to
          kiss Carl but is shrugged off, she laughs to herself as she heads to
          bottom of the stairs to the club, she says goodbye to Jennifer and
          leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he turns to the stage only to see Jennifer looking at him, she says
          bye and is about to leave the club, as she is about to take the
          stairs, she is interrupted by…
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fancy a lock in?” he asks her, she turns her head around and reply
          “What about Malena?”
        </p>
        <p>“What about her?”</p>
        <p>
          She walks to the back of the bar to get out a bottle of wine, she
          leans towards him.
        </p>
        <p>“What would you like?”</p>
        <p>“Half a lager.”</p>
        <p>
          She opens the bottle and pours herself a wine, and gives him his lager
          “Every time you come here, I see you drink the one, compared to many
          people here who don’t seem to know when to stop.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t want to turn into an alcoholic now do I, I know my limits”
          saying with a smile on his face taking a sip.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Man, the amount of drunks I see drooling over me and Malena every
          night, you two having a lovers quall?”
        </p>
        <p>“We want different things, she wants me and I want someone else.”</p>
        <p>
          “Listen I don’t want to come in the middle of you to, she my friend
          and she doesn’t seem happy lately.”
        </p>
        <p>“She’s a big girl, she will get over it.”</p>
        <p>“You know, you don’t look the type.”</p>
        <p>“Type?”</p>
        <p>“Settling down type.”</p>
        <p>“Looks can be deceiving, why did you get cold feet?”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
        <p>“Come on, my apartment, you had a foot inside…”</p>
        <p>
          “No cold feet, I’m not a one night girl, especially from the fact that
          I know that you like to promise the waitresses that golden ticket to
          Hollywood.
        </p>
        <p>
          “That was the past, I wasn’t in a good place, though the past few
          months I being turning a new leaf since I saw you that first time in
          the club. But hopefully with some good developments coming my way in
          the next few days, my future is starting to have a silver lining.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Malena has mentioned you to possibly leaving this place, shame she
          isn’t going with you, she needs a break, we all could do with a silver
          lining instead of singing for short change.”
        </p>
        <p>“What is your dream?”</p>
        <p>
          “Theatre maybe, Las Vegas, performing on Broadway in New York, London
          anywhere that would have the big plays like Guys and Dolls, Mac and
          Mabel something with big musical numbers you know, maybe acting on the
          big screen, but singing has always been my first love.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl gets up from the bar and walks towards the stage; his mind is
          processing a solution to their escapism. He turns back to her and as
          he heads back to the bar, he gives Jennifer a proposition. “When I get
          the money I need to leave here, we will move to Las Vegas then tour if
          you can put up with me?”
        </p>
        <p>“You serious?”</p>
        <p>
          Carl having screwing over Joey in mind has a smile on his face as he
          sips the last drop. He gets from the bar looking at her all the way to
          the door and says “Absolutely.” She holds towards him and smiles and
          kisses him on the cheek.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the club, the rain stopped as he stands outside the club. He
          opens his wallet and looks at a photo of his sister, in the photo with
          a smile on her face. He looks up and puts the photo back in his wallet
          and heads down the street. Jennifer comes running out and grabs Carl
          and places him on the wall, they both panting staring at each other,
          he goes to kiss her; she then hesitates and goes back.
        </p>
        <p>“Did you mean what you say?” as she smiles at him.</p>
        <p>“Kiss me and you will see.”</p>
        <p>She goes up to him again “Not settling down type eh?”</p>
        <p>He smiles back “Appearances can be deceiving.”</p>
        <p>
          She moves back and walks away smiling at him as she goes. He smiles
          back not frustrating but knowing she is playing hard to get knowing he
          likes it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          While Jennifer and Carl were having this conversation in the club,
          which is leading at times them being quite close in the club. Malena
          was heading home and heads through the alleyway only for the sound of
          someone calling her from the shadows. She turns to the dark area where
          the figure comes out and moves towards Malena. His face was familiar
          to her as she doesn’t have any fear on her face but is annoyed as it
          someone connected to Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What happened? All you had to do is finish her and make it like Carl
          killed her.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “He was too quick for me, you sure as hell didn’t tell me he is a
          copper.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Was, a disgraced ex copper who had his fingers in a lot of gangster’s
          pies.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the robber who was stopped by Carl while trying to get to him
          and Jennifer. Then out of nowhere two men had attacked the robber with
          baseball bats until he was dead. One of the men gives Malena a phone;
          she takes it in fear, which then turns to exasperation and frustration
          when she hears the voice of Joey on the other end.
        </p>
        <p>“I want him to suffer Joey.”</p>
        <p>“You had your orders, don’t pull a stunt like that again.”</p>
        <p>
          “Fine.” She throws the phone back to one of the men; they pick up the
          body of the robber and leave through the alley, throw him into the van
          and drive off.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As the sun starts to set, which is coming close to the meet of the
          Vice President paying Joey over Malena. Malena sits on the edge of the
          bed in a motel, Westwood on the other side sleeping. Malena naked with
          her make up all smudged all over her face. She stands up looking out
          the window at the sunset, her and Westwood clothes all over the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gets dressed as Westwood is waking up, she goes into her bag and
          throws the envelope onto the lap of Westwood as he sits up in bed.
        </p>
        <p>“What’s this?”</p>
        <p>
          “An insurance policy from Joey Marciano. He is going into a new
          business venture and needs a cash flow injection which you are going
          to fund.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You crazy?” as he opens the envelope to reveal pictures of the love
          affair of several meetings with Malena and some with know girls that
          he has dealings with. “I presume Joey has copies of these?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “On file, ready to email to the President and every news outlet which
          I believe your wife works in, not nice to plant the Vice President all
          over the news.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He gets up and grabs her and then calms down. “When does he want meet
          and how much?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “In two hours, he needs a two million dollars, he needs you to make
          his new business remains clean from any political investigations.”
        </p>
        <p>“Fine.”</p>
        <p>
          “I’m coming with you to meet to make sure everything runs smoothly.”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          With an hour left till the meet, Carl and Ritchie are on top of the
          hill looking down at the warehouse, they move to the boot of Ritchie’s
          Mustang.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why did you bring this, you know even if you get it scratched you get
          a hissy fit, god knows how you will react with bullet holes.” as Carl
          circles around his car and returns to the boot.
        </p>
        <p>
          “It will be out of sight.” as Ritchie opens the boot revealing a
          selection of guns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl picks up a shotgun and places a gun tucked in his trousers at his
          waist. Ritchie takes out a pair of handguns. They compare them and
          Carl has a cheeky grin on his face as he looks at his shotgun, Ritchie
          shakes his head knowing the joke but not amused as he loads up the
          guns.
        </p>
        <p>“It isn’t the size, it’s the duration.” Ritchie assures Carl.</p>
        <p>
          “Remember if not necessary, don’t get trigger happy out there
          especially when the Vice President is vulnerable.”
        </p>
        <p>“Of course” as Carl loads up the shotgun.</p>
        <p>
          They both get back in the car and drive down the windy roads down the
          hill. The Vice President leaves the Motel with Malena, They head into
          his car, both looking concerned for different reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of the grand entrance of his Plaza comes Joey with an excited
          smile on his face as he goes into his white stretched limo. The limo
          heads away from the Las Vegas strip, as it travels through a long
          highway, a van follows him. He knows that this deal could set him up
          in the higher nonchalant with political influences from the Vice
          President, while being an expanding entrepreneur as he wants to be
          approved by his dad who he looked to his dad during the 80/90s was a
          big business man in Las Vegas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As evening falls, the meet is being prepared. The warehouse which
          contains dumped machinery parts and parts of bodies off old cars,
          indicating it used to be a garage or a car showroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          A car pulls up which contain Westwood and Malena at the main entrance
          of the warehouse. At the side of the warehouse Ritchie is parked in
          his car with an earpiece to hear in on surveillance from a small
          device. All this wasn’t new to Carl as before he was a CIA Operate and
          had some experience on sting operations before dropping to LAPD, it
          was only high profiles mistakes that cost him his high acclaim. He
          wants to get back into the field and clear his conscience and his
          reputation, whatever his clear motivation of revenge or
          reconciliation, he is determined to make this right as in the past he
          was involved with some of the criminal activity while being in the
          LAPD while working with Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the warehouse, there is an office with stairs on the left side of
          the warehouse leading to it. The office is, a perfect vantage point
          where he waits with a shotgun, as he is perched under the window. The
          window is smashed through, so he can wait, he places the gun
          underneath the window frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malena and Westwood arrive into the warehouse, Westwood is carrying a
          laptop bag. Malena looks around to see if Carl is here. Carl sees them
          from the vantage point of the office and quickly hid down not knowing
          she would turn up and be involved with this, knowing the danger she be
          in when Joey arrives. He is confused and annoyed that she is at the
          meet, he has some regrets of the way he has treated her, he cares
          about her with the choices she had made in her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind is going a million miles an hour, he knows that what he is
          about to do is going to end bad if there are any complications with
          the deal. He has to do this, as he doesn’t want another girl’s death
          on his conscience. He looks at Malena and goes “Screw it” as he and
          goes down to the warehouse ground. He forgets the shotgun, which is
          always a mistake to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he confronts them both, Malena turns trying to act confident in
          this tricky situation. “You arrived then.” She deep down hoped he
          wouldn’t show but it was wishful thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You need to get out of here, I will settle this with Joey for you.”
        </p>
        <p>“Who the hell are you?” asks Westwood.</p>
        <p>“The man going to get you out of this Mr Vice President.”</p>
        <p>“You can’t, so I suggest you leave.”</p>
        <p>“No, no, I think you should have some protection.”</p>
        <p>“What does Joey have on you then?” Carl asks Westwood.</p>
        <p>“Classified.”</p>
        <p>
          “Classified” smirking as he knows how tight lipped the departments
          are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Westwood takes out the laptop and places it on the table. Malena
          confused “What is the laptop about?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “What you think I was going to bring a duffle bag full of cash did
          you?” as he sets up for a wire transfer of the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Everyone does there job right and everyone will be ok.” as Malena
          points a gun a Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What the hell, come on Joey won’t get you out of this, he will
          continue to dig and dig at you until there is nothing left of you.” as
          he tries to reason with her in a calm tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You think I’m doing for Joey, I’m doing this for me!” she says while
          almost in tears trying to keep her composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yesterday you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me, now you
          want me dead.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I am sick of playing second fiddle.” she gets her phone and calls “I
          got him, come in.”
        </p>
        <p>“Listen what ever….” Carl tries to say.</p>
        <p>“Shut it and sort that transfer.” as Malena orders Westwood.</p>
        <p>
          The sight and the sound of the white stretched limo come into the main
          entrance as Malena and Carl continue to look at each other. The limo
          parks into the centre of the warehouse, the van that followed had
          parked on the side of the limo. Carl turns his head around to see the
          man he has wanted to get his hands on for the past two years. The
          chauffeur gets out of the drivers seat and goes to the back to escort
          Joey out, he gets out in a expensive suit with a smug look on his face
          looking like he is part of the mafia, feeling like a million bucks as
          he looks at Carl. But he hasn’t been in a real fight in his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He strolls down to the three of them as his men exit the van. They
          line up in front of the van; Joey starts to slowly clap his hands, as
          he gets closer to them.
        </p>
        <p>“Malena, what did I tell you before?”</p>
        <p>“I needed some way to keep him here.”</p>
        <p>
          “Come on, you know as well as I do that you have to tie a line of
          bulls and having a massive red flag in his way to stop him from coming
          here, now drop the gun, ill take it from here.” As he pushes lightly
          the gun down with an out stretched arm as he looks at Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ok I’m here type in your account you details and start the transfer.”
          Westwood instructs Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey by clicking his fingers calls one his men over and talks in his
          ear, the man searches Carl for a weapon where he then takes out the
          gun Carl had hiding. The man goes to the Vice President to search him,
          then goes to the laptop and types in the details to start the
          transfer, he then heads back to the other men in front of the van,
          while the wire transfer starts to process, but will take a little bit
          of time to complete.
        </p>
        <p>“Thank you Vice President, you are no longer needed.”</p>
        <p>“This is it now, no more blackmail.”</p>
        <p>
          “You paid, that’s it, well it’s nice to have you for any little thing
          I need, but you are truly no longer needed.” one of Joey’s men points
          a gun and shots the Vice President in the chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What the hell you doing, you’ll get the gas chamber.” Malena looking
          shocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I know but we didn’t shoot him, Carl did.” As he gets out another
          gun, the man in gloves gives it to Joey who is also wearing gloves
          places it in Carl hand for prints and takes it back to place it down
          on the floor to the side of Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Now, Malena lets take a look at the merchandise, shall we.” as he
          heads back to the limo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl looks at Malena realising that Malena is in much deeper than he
          first thought. As Carl goes to his men and gets to the van, Malena
          slides her gun into the back of Carl’s waist trousers. Carl looking a
          bit perplexed but happy she seems at apparent change of heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You get me out of this, we ransack Joey casino and go our separate
          ways.” She whispers in his ear.
        </p>
        <p>“What about Joey, he will chase you and kill you.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll take my chances.”</p>
        <p>
          “There is a guy outside that can gets us out of here.” Carl suggests
          discreetly.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Joey is in the limo, Ritchie wanting to get Joey in the act
          creeps in the warehouse through a hole in the side of the warehouse,
          he hides through the parts of machinery and keeps hidden in other
          parts in the place, and then heads to the office. He notices the
          shotgun leaning stood up on the windowsill, he is equipped with the
          two guns in his back of trousers tucked in, he picks the shotgun up
          muttering. “You idiot Carl.” He looks down on them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jeez, where could you be without me, saving your sorry ass.” He says
          to himself as he looks around the office and then looks at what is
          going on with Joey as he waits in the office out of sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then from the limo Joey shouts out “Your going to love this Carl!” He
          brings out a girl and pushes her into his men who keep a grin of her.
          Carl’s face turns white as a sheet, as it was his sister Kiera. He
          rushes only to be stop by Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ah, Ah, Ah.” Joey points a gun at Carl’s head. Carl face turns to
          anger, as he has been tricked and imagines the hell she has been in
          through being in Joey’s clutches since he saw her two years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Shame you fled like you did, you had a glamorous life with me and my
          family. I fell for that sob story about the CIA left you in the cold,
          I brought you in as one of my own, my family. You should be grateful
          that I have saved her life for you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You kept her in solitary confinement for two years and didn’t tell
          me, why the hell should I show you gratitude.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well you were hard to find, when left Chicago you became a ghost,
          Malena and I found each other thanks to her trying her luck one too
          many times with the roulette table. Trust it would been easier to kill
          her after I found her stealing from me, but I have morals, not like
          you.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Makes sense now, you know I wasn’t responsible for him, I took him to
          nursery for you, don’t you think I don’t have that image of him being
          shot out of my head.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “He died because you messed up the deal, I told not to mess with the
          Turks, I TOLD YOU, HE’S DEAD CAUSE OF YOU!!!” Joey in a rage squashes
          the gun at his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you need redemption, just kill me, just let her and Malena go.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey turns to Malena, then Kiera and says to Carl “I saw Shane die in
          front of me, now will you.” he gets another gun and points it at
          Kiera.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What is going on here, what has this got to do with the business
          venture? Malena asks Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Malena, Malena, Malena, we will settle this men, by the way I don’t
          brothels.” Joey then shoots Malena in the chest. “You just bait for
          this very moment…RIGHT HERE!!!” as he looks at Malena dying, Carl goes
          to her to try to save her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malena looks scared mouths to Carl “I’m sorry.” as she takes her last
          breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl gets up and starts to realise what was the intention. He turns to
          Joey who’s has a smile on his face, a beeping sound comes from the
          laptop indicating a problem with the laptop, it is stuck at 69%, Joey
          calls for his man to fix the problem.
        </p>
        <p>“This isn’t about the money was it? Why kill them?”</p>
        <p>
          “Oh it is about the money, trust me, but it is about vengeance,
          framing you for killing Malena originally was nice, a copper, sorry ex
          copper will flourish in prison I hear, but when she has a Vice
          President laying next to her, WOW the game just got more fun, that’s
          the green mile.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “What about Kiera? Well she done so well for me so far, I suppose I
          can have more use for her, a bit it will hurt, you thinking what will
          happen to her while you sit in that cell.” Joey looks at her toying
          with her, mocking Carl as he points the gun at Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl looking at Kiera mouthing “it will be ok.” She looking scared
          mouthing “ok”. Ritchie looks on knowing this needs to stop shouts out
          “Joey Marciano!” Joey roams the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          They turn the office, he heads down to the bottom with a shotgun
          pointed at the Joey.
        </p>
        <p>“Its ok Carl, its over Joey.”</p>
        <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
        <p>“LAPD”</p>
        <p>Joey turns to Carl “All for one is it?”</p>
        <p>“No just Ritchie, Ritchie put it down, they will kill her.”</p>
        <p>“No he won’t.” as he continues to point at Joey.</p>
        <p>“I got a better idea.” as Joey then points the gun towards Kiera.</p>
        <p>
          Carl gets out his gun from his back quickly and sprints towards the
          laptop and shoots it as it is destroyed at 87%.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey screams out knowing the money has gone, his men start shooting at
          him but Carl flips the table on its side to use as a shield. Ritchie
          heads behind the table and starts shooting at the men, kills one with
          the rest go behind the van and get in to fire back. Ritchie and Carl
          shielded gives the shotgun to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kiera tries to escape by the table, but is quickly grabbed by Joey and
          then chucked back to the men as they head into the van. Joey fires at
          Carl and Ritchie as he enters his limo; it starts to drive off with
          the van. Ritchie shoots one of the limos tyres, Carl runs out and
          grabs onto the back of the van as it exits the warehouse. He drops the
          shotgun but still has the gun in his hands as holds on top of the van.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritchie chases the limo down the airstrip. He shoots another front
          tyre causing the limo to slow, the chauffeur gets out and tries to
          escapes but Joey shoots him. Ritchie grabs Joey, they scuffle and the
          struggle Joey manages to shoot him in the lower arm. Ritchie punches
          Joey and throws him over the bonnet of the limo. While Ritchie is in
          pain, Joey tries to escape and looks at the van. Ritchie tries to grab
          him, but Joey whacks him on the head with the gun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl is on top of the van trying to get to the driver, Joey points his
          gun and shoots the driver with determined smile on his face. The van
          loses control and heads towards the limo, Joey and Ritchie flees away
          from the limo, the van crashes into it flinging Carl off it over the
          limo into the ground which causes the van and limo burst into flames
          killing the men and to Carl’s horror, Kiera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey escapes off into the nearby woods angry but somewhat smug at
          losing the money as he sees Carl laying on his side, shocked and
          upset, looking at the gulf of flames. Ritchie comes to him and
          comforts him in his arms as they are left at the wreckage.
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As the night reaches the early hours towards the sun rising, Joey
          steals a car and heads back towards the Plaza to collect his passport
          and some other essentials. He then drives south to get the borders to
          get into Mexico. Once he gets there, he needs to think up of a
          strategy in order to clean up the mess he is in. He reaches Texas
          where he reaches the town of El Paso.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to Joey being at the top of the business empire, he is
          always wanting more. In his early years when he had some small
          businesses, he meet a young Turkish man which he went into business
          with them to clear up a debt he had various people, one a Turkish
          mobster.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on, they found him in Las Vegas and have been trying to
          get the money back, he tried on a previous occasion and didn’t work
          out well and the interest went up. He was going to make it another
          casino as a front to launder money and to help the Turks expand on
          their business dealings overseas. It was also an opportunity for him
          to get richer and become a billionaire. The Turks have been lenient on
          him because of the good working relationship with Marciano Snr.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now on the run he has five hundred dollars in his pocket. He drives
          through discreetly not to draw attention while in the town, he then
          stops at the traffic lights. As he waits impatiently, he gets his
          phone to call his dad only to be harassed by a random guy cleaning his
          windscreen.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Joey is distracted trying to get him to go, a head pops out and
          points a gun at him. Joey catches him in the corner of his eye,
          quickly whacks the gun to the side and slams his foot on the throttle
          that drives the car into the crossing; a four-wheeler truck crashes
          into the passenger’s side of the car. The two robbers ransack Joey and
          the trucker of their money has they are on their vehicles, the robbers
          and run off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey is sitting in his cell two days later still in Texas, unscaved
          from the crash but annoyed as he looks forward at the overweight guard
          scoffing a donut down his neck.
        </p>
        <p>“I want my lawyer.” He says calmly but frustrated.</p>
        <p>
          “He’s coming, takes time to come from Las Vegas, so you just sit there
          like a good little boy.” the guard suggests as he examines the gun
          Joey had.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Better watch out, you will lose something,” he says with a smirk on
          his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard who is wearing gloves places the gun in an evidence bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I want my phone call.” as Joey has his head down. Being ignored by
          the guard.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          At the warehouse, the forensic team corners it off; they scale the
          crime scene of the burnt wreckage, while being sent off to the morgue.
          They can find the envelope with the photos of the love affair between
          Malena and the Vice President in his car outside the warehouse. They
          piece together as they found a gun with Carl’s prints on it, Ritchie’s
          prints are also there but as a witness. But there is a piece of
          evidence to show Joey was there, a small piece of evidence from the
          wrecked limo to show it was Joeys’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jennifer is sitting in her house at the dinner table; she opens the
          newspaper to see the main headline on the front page that reads “VICE
          PRESIDENT KILLED IN WAREHOUSE MASSACRE.” She not knowing that Carl is
          involved goes to the bedroom to gets some things from her bag and
          starts to dial her phone as she leaves her house.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she heads down the street, she goes into her car and drives off to
          Carl’s apartment. After getting no answer, she rings his phone only to
          get no answer. She really worried but heads to go work to try to clear
          her head, as she realises he may not be good for her after all.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In a motel on the outskirts of the Las Vegas, Carl is sitting on the
          edge of the bed. He stares at the photo of Kiera looking with no
          expression as it is unusual for him as he already grieved for her once
          thinking she was dead and doesn’t know how to react. He feels useless,
          as he knows that Joey got his vengeance and could be out of the
          country by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phone starts to ring as Carl continues to look at the photo. He on
          an out stretched arm answers the phone and says nothing as he listens
          to hear Ritchie’s voice on the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen to me, promise to me you won’t do anything rational, they
          found him in Texas, he is in a police cell waiting for his lawyer, I’m
          heading down there now to interrogate him. It will be just him, his
          lawyer and me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is in order to straighten this out, so sit tight. I promise I
          will get him for Kiera….” as Carl hangs up the phone. He grabs his
          coat and puts his hoodie up with shades on as he heads out the motel.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          That evening Jennifer performs at the club but struggles a little bit,
          but then keeps her composure as she comes to the end of the song. She
          is consumed with the grief of the death of Malena. The mood of the
          club is a bit muted from the recent events but somewhat upbeat as the
          drink takes over.
        </p>
        <p>
          She then goes back to her dressing room; the sight of Malena’s
          dressing room that doesn’t have her name on the door anymore stops
          her. The entrance is flooded with flowers and cards of customers who
          loved her performing. As she goes into her own dressing room, a head
          pops closes up which was Carl. Jennifer sees him and freezes, then
          goes towards to her phone only to be stopped when Carl tries to reason
          with her.
        </p>
        <p>“Jennifer please, I need to talk.”</p>
        <p>
          “You killed Malena, why would you do that?” as she starts to dial.
        </p>
        <p>“Listen to me I didn’t kill anyone, there is a lot to explain.”</p>
        <p>
          As she waits on the line and an officer answer on the other side, she
          freezes by Carl saying. “I saw my sister killed at the warehouse.”
          Jennifer puts the phone down confused. She turns to him at the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What?” she couldn’t believe what she heard as he plants the picture
          of her on the window.
        </p>
        <p>“Joey Marciano, have you heard of him?”</p>
        <p>
          “Malena has mentioned him once or twice, she was not really one for
          being open about things, she didn’t really mention in glowing terms
          though.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “She got into bad dealings with him, he was the one who killed her,
          please let me come in and explain.” as he holds up his hand and the
          gun placed on the window with the handle facing her, she opens the
          slider window and takes the gun using a towel and takes it onto the
          side. Carl climbs into the room through the window saying thanks to
          her as he enters the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          They both head to the sofa, Jennifer looking slightly nervous with the
          gun on the table opposite them not sure what to take with what Carl is
          saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I know there will be a way to get into your dressing room.” Trying to
          ease the situation with humour. She smiles at him “So, you going to
          tell me what the hell is going on.” she asks calmly at ease.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s a long story with no much time to explain it.”</p>
        <p>“Try.”</p>
        <p>
          “I was in the CIA a few years ago, that didn’t work out in the LAPD,
          they found I would work with the Marciano family, more history there,
          not important. To get some money and contacts I went rogue for a while
          I was in the LAPD. I worked along side him for some dealings…” “Try
          and get deeper and well Marciano Snr were a kind of father to me.”
        </p>
        <p>“Never thought you were this soppy, glad I didn’t kiss you now.”</p>
        <p>“You always like this?”</p>
        <p>“So you chose blood money over a LAPD pension.”</p>
        <p>
          “Ok, he used to run an underground fighting ring that I was a part
          of.”
        </p>
        <p>“Gets better and better.”</p>
        <p>
          “Yeah, betting on men who wanted to let out frustration by kicking the
          crap out of each other.” “Joey Snr can be persuasive, I found out my
          sister was working undercover there while in the CIA at one of their
          sting operations. She tried to help me out of this, there was a
          problem where she was shot.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Wait, this was two years ago, what was the warehouse about then, you
          said she was killed there.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Joey kept her alive and kept in captivity because he wanted to kill
          her in front of my eyes.”
        </p>
        <p>“Ah Jeez, how did you find?” as she comforts him.</p>
        <p>“Malena.” Finishing her question.</p>
        <p>
          “That’s why you were always around her, you used her.” Jennifer makes
          the connection.
        </p>
        <p>“At first, then I felt guilty, I backed off.”</p>
        <p>“Because of me.”</p>
        <p>
          “No, I could see it was toxic, I drank more and more and slept around,
          promising girls success to stroke my ego.”
        </p>
        <p>“Nice way of putting.” Knowing what he really meant.</p>
        <p>“How the hell did the Vice President get involved in this?”</p>
        <p>“Blackmail, I found it was a deploy to frame me for the murders.”</p>
        <p>“Just go to the cops and explain this.”</p>
        <p>“A disgraced ex cop, might as well walk the green mile.”</p>
        <p>
          “Have you other family, friends.” He nods no. “Ok, I haven’t got much
          but I’ll get a good lawyer and straight this out.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I have a friend, a cop. He was at the warehouse so I just need to lay
          low till he settles it.”
        </p>
        <p>“You actually going to do that?”</p>
        <p>
          “No, but I have no choice, I need to do the smart thing for the second
          time this week.”
        </p>
        <p>“What was the first?”</p>
        <p>
          “Finally having the courage to talk to you.” as he smiles at her. She
          smiling back at him looking a little embarrassed. They have moment
          where something may happen; he thinks about it but decides for the
          right time, not while he’s on the run.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl gets up, he looks at the gun on the table and picks it up and
          puts it into a holder under his hoodie top. He turns to her ready to
          kiss her, and then kisses her on the forehead. He goes outside the
          window and looks around to check street clear.
        </p>
        <p>“What you going to do?”</p>
        <p>“The right thing for once.” as he heads off into the night.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The same evening in Texas at the police station, Joey and his lawyer
          are in the interrogation room waiting. Ritchie enters the room and
          leans on the chair, arms on the table looking at Joey. He then gets a
          remote and turns off the camera that is on the corner of the room.
          Joey looks at the recording device on the side with a raised smile on
          his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Aint you going to turn that on?” Knowing the stakes and knowing
          Ritchie can’t afford to as he continues to grin.
        </p>
        <p>“What do you think?”</p>
        <p>
          Joey lies back on the chair looking confident, his lawyer doesn’t
          change expression, as he knows the situation as Joey’s lawyer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So, no witnesses, no other cops here. You have leverage, I have some
          leverage, so let’s work on something.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “What’s that, I have Carl right in the palm of my hand, now he is on
          the rampage for me. What can you possibly do to tarnish that?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “How about a recorded account of the whole messy meeting. It is great
          where you can place a device and even how much smaller and smaller
          these devices can be, but just as effective.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Carl is nothing to you cops anymore, just let me have him and this
          will be over, he cost me my ticket out of something much bigger than
          he can ever imagine.”
        </p>
        <p>“How can you get him from being in here?”</p>
        <p>“Alright.” Joey looks at his lawyer who nods yes back at him.</p>
        <p>
          “Ok.” as leans forward to Ritchie. “I propose this, you get me out
          this mess, I’ll make sure Carl is not shown as the murderer. I have
          the pieces that could put the murders onto someone, my men will be
          perfect.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “They are your men, It will be traced to you as your limo was there.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Do you know what? Picture it, Vice President is cosy not with a wife,
          but Malena. They have a love affair that is perfect for anyone with a
          brain cell to take and blackmail in order to get rich, they have the
          meet at the warehouse, and it gets a bit nasty everyone is dead, case
          close. No one needs to know about Malena love affair with Carl.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “What about Carl’s prints, need to explain why he is there?” he thinks
          for a minute. “Ok, Carl could be protection for the Vice President, he
          wont trust certain people in politics, and he sure as hell won’t want
          to let anyone else know. Ok hire Joey, ill come along for any nasty
          stuff as it would be quick and easy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “There’s me thinking I would think it all up for you.” as he looks at
          his lawyer and back at Ritchie. He gets up with his lawyer and go out
          to leave he whispers in Ritchie’s ear. “The house always wins.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ritchie gets up and grabs Joey and slams him to the wall. His lawyer
          looks to get someone.
        </p>
        <p>“Its ok, Ritchie was just escorting me out.”</p>
        <p>
          “That’s right, Daddy won’t wipe your backside forever.” as he lets
          Joey go, Joey straightens himself up and leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey leaves and stands outside the police station, he is annoyed at
          the comment about his father, as he is always known of having a silver
          spoon not being his own man. He knows that he in the end has lost out,
          as he couldn’t get Carl done for the murders, but is confident there
          will be another day as they are now both in the clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          He waits for a taxi or the car his lawyer would come in with. He turns
          to his lawyer asking where his car is, before he can even say a few
          sentences he get whacked in the head with a fist. He places a phone
          and speaks in a European language, not an obvious, but more from
          Serbia, Soviet. Then a van turns up, two men get out and pick up Joey
          and dump him in the back. The lawyer speaks to the men as and he gets
          in the passenger seat, they return to the van and they drive off.
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next few days were all developments about the case, which was
          eventually closed. Ritchie and Carl were sitting in a pub having
          drinks watching the T.V in the corner. The announcement from the news
          was the case was closed and they were doing tributes for the vice
          President painting him as a victim, despite many affairs on the side
          that were hidden away.
        </p>
        <p>“So, what now for you?” Ritchie wonders as he turns to Carl.</p>
        <p>
          Carl sits there a little while thinking. “I’m tired of this place,
          there is so much can handle, after this scare, you know it could be a
          sign. All the cheap drink and all the girls, losing Kiera really puts
          things into perspective. Before I didn’t know she is dead, thought for
          a time she was in pain, suffering, and then accepting she was dead,
          then not if that makes sense. Now knowing she is at piece with our
          gran who she loved dearly, helps me out a little, I need to live right
          for her.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “The chief spoke to me today, hearing what you were willing to do for
          the Vice President getting injured in the ‘line of duty’, he is
          offering you a place in the force consulting.” Ritchie offers.
        </p>
        <p>“Out of the goodness out of his heart.” Carl says sarcastically.</p>
        <p>
          “He wants to paint a beautiful picture, you a reformed character
          working for the respectable vice President, injured in combat, you
          usual know BS.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I need to start new, new place, new career goals. I might dab my
          hands in cars maybe, being at that warehouse brings back old memories
          of me and my dad working on classic cars.”
        </p>
        <p>“With what’s her face Jenna?”</p>
        <p>“Jennifer, eh maybe.” as he contemplates the idea.</p>
        <p>
          “Lucky boy, when interrogating Joey said something weird, he said that
          you cost him a ticket out of something far bigger than you can
          imagine.”
        </p>
        <p>“Just him mouthing off.”</p>
        <p>
          As they continue to drink, Carl started to see the future it was
          starting to look bright.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          That evening, at an abandoned barn on the side of a long highway out
          skirts of Nirvana, it was situated in a large field in front of the
          mountains. One of the beams inside has Joey tied up dangling upside
          down, He is panicking and struggling to get out of the ropes confused,
          then suddenly a van reverses into the barn. The sound of dogs barking
          stops Joey in his tracks as he frozen in fear with a gag in his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two men come to the back of the van and open the back doors to reveal
          two rockviellers dogs in the back with metal fencing stopping them
          from ripping Joey’s head off. Joey’s eyes bulge out with fear on his
          face screaming through the gag. Thinking at what will happen to him if
          they set free.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bright flashlight shines at Joey’s head, sweat pours out of his
          forehead as he is dangling in fear. This is a situation that Joey
          believes that he can’t get out of this and knows his dad can’t save
          him this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of the passenger seat comes the “lawyer” which isn’t in the suit
          that he came to the interrogation room with. He walks towards Joey in
          camouflage outfit, as he is actually part of the Turkish military. He
          looks back at the dogs and commands them to quiet; he looks back at
          Joey with smile on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          A helicopter lands outside the barn; a man walks through the side and
          heads towards Joey and looks at him close up. He is dressed in a
          business suit with a large coat; he turns to his deputy and speaks to
          him in Turkish. The deputy and his men cut him down safety and they
          tie him to one of the horizontal beams in the middle of the barn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man paces back and forth in front of him, he calls his men away
          from him. He comes towards Joey; his face is calmed almost happy,
          which confused Joey.
        </p>
        <p>“You think I’m idiot, yes?”</p>
        <p>“No Mr Selkan.”</p>
        <p>
          “Really, I give you chance to pay for your sins, thanks to your lawyer
          (as he looks at the deputy) you are free, but trust me, you will wish
          that you were in that cell because your time is now up.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Please, Please (as he turn to tears) I will get you the money, please
          let me get my dad.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Shut up! Your voice insults me, it is thanks to your dad’s influences
          that have helped my people in the past, and your dad helped my
          businesses back out of certain situations in the 90s to get me going.
          You’re dead luckily that he has told that I should give you a final
          chance. Loyalty is important to me so I won’t release those dogs to
          feast on your snivelling body.” He walks around “He has managed to buy
          you a week, one week to this debt which is now five million.”
        </p>
        <p>“There was a reason, this copper got in the way.”</p>
        <p>
          “Excuses, excuses, excuses, I don’t care of your problems, I want
          payment, and this time my deputy will comply you to make sure you do
          it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I have a suggestion that guarantee it but I need something to make it
          work.”
        </p>
        <p>“What”</p>
        <p>“This copper is a problem, I need him controlled.”</p>
        <p>“We not kidnap police, the heat we get is not worth risk.”</p>
        <p>
          “Not him, there is a girl he likes, you kidnap her, he will do
          anything.”
        </p>
        <p>“I don’t follow.”</p>
        <p>
          “You get him to rob a high profile bank, he is ex CIA so it will be no
          problem, to get his money back, he doesn’t, you kill the girl.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The man walks around, brings his deputy over. The deputy talks to the
          men and untie Joey.
        </p>
        <p>“What does she look like?”</p>
        <p>
          “I don’t know, but her name is Jennifer Cruz, she works that this club
          in Nirvana, she works tonight so best time to get her after closing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Last chance, or my dogs get fed, not after my men have fun with you
          first.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The man heads back to his helicopter; the deputy and his men take Joey
          into his van as they head out down the highway.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next morning Carl heads towards Jennifer’s house. As he enters the
          walkway, he sees Ritchie at the front door. He is waiting at the door
          which looks like it is broken through, but not a robber kick through
          doors but more discreet, a more professional job. Ritchie got a tip
          from a noisy neighbour who saw torchlights through the house at the
          time and heard of a struggle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl looks confused, then as he gets closer to the door, he realises
          there was a big problem when he sees the door. He rushes past Ritchie
          into the house calling for her as he searches the house. He goes back
          out of the front door to talk to Ritchie.
        </p>
        <p>“Where is she?” as he is confused and worried.</p>
        <p>
          “I don’t know, I found this on the table.” as Ritchie hands him an
          envelope. Carl then opens the envelope to reveal a card that has a
          phone number on it. He looks at Ritchie perplexed; he gets his phone
          and deals the number waiting to see what is going on. The phone
          continues to dial where to Carl’s fear, comes true; he hears
          Jennifer’s voice scared on the other end.
        </p>
        <p>“Jennifer, where are you? What’s going on?”</p>
        <p>Then the Turkish mobster comes onto the phone.</p>
        <p>“You are Carl, yes?”</p>
        <p>“Who the hell is this? Why do you have Jennifer?”</p>
        <p>“You have cost me a substantial amount of money.”</p>
        <p>
          He and Ritchie go into the house into the dinning room and Carl puts
          his phone onto loudspeaker so that Ritchie can hear it also.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Listen, if this is from years ago, Joey Marciano is the man you
          need.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don’t know from years ago, I’m talking a couple of days ago when
          the certain Joey Marciano was paying me back for a debt, a certain
          five million?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “He is your problem, he owes you, its nothing to do with me or
          Jennifer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I would advise that you would co-operate because her life will end at
          my hands if you don’t comply.”
        </p>
        <p>“How the hell I’m I going to get that kind of money?”</p>
        <p>
          “Limited as Joey is in intelligence, he has offered that you and him
          will rob the bank in L.A.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You kidding, me and Joey, I rather shoot him than see him, let along
          work with him again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Well, you don’t, she will die, since he screwed it up for me, he can
          do his part of the job to make sure I get my money.”
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where and when?” Carl pauses for a minute knowing he hasn’t got a
          choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You meet my men and Joey on top of the L.A Mountains where the
          Hollywood sign is placed at 6am.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl hangs up the phone and heads out the house and gets in his car;
          Ritchie gets into the passenger seat.
        </p>
        <p>“What you doing?” Carl tells Ritchie.</p>
        <p>“You can’t do this alone.”</p>
        <p>
          “Last chance, or my dogs get fed, not after my men have fun with you
          first.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m doing this alone, I can’t afford slip ups, let me do the robbery
          and when I go for Jennifer you can back me up, no earlier.”
        </p>
        <p>“Jeez, fine.” as they drive off.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The next morning at 6am at the top of L.A. by the Hollywood sign, Carl
          is sitting on the bonnet. The van turns up and parks by the car, Joey
          gets out of the van and is immediately grabbed by Carl. Carl in
          frustration slams him into the side of the van and onto the bonnet and
          planting Joey face down on the bonnet. The other men get out and point
          their guns at Carl. Carl looks at them knowing his odds of escape are
          slim to none; the deputy gets out of the van and goes up close to
          Carl.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s not wise to kill, yes?”</p>
        <p>
          “Just saying hello.” as he turned to the deputy smiling. Carl then
          kicks Joey in the nuts; Joey drops down the van onto the ground. The
          deputy not looking concerned as Joey clearly deserved it for his
          actions. The men picks up Joey and gathers Carl and the men to the
          bonnet of Carl’s car as they go over a blueprint of the bank they plan
          to rob with. The deputy gives Carl body armour and a shotgun.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plan is that they plan to rob the bank at opening time at 9am that
          is in three hours time. The men involved are the deputy, his three men
          with Carl and Joey; three of the deputy’s men will patrol the main
          bank floor. The deputy will support them on the floor; and finally
          Carl and Joey will be in the safe to collect the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          As 9am approaches, the crew prepare to leave, Joey and Carl are
          defensive, and making sure the other doesn’t try anything. The Deputy
          making sure it all goes to plan. Carl nods to indicate he will follow
          the job through. Joey does the same, still in discomfort. They all get
          in the van and drive down the windy streets towards the glitz and
          glamour of Los Angeles. The Turk mobster is in the club where Jennifer
          works sitting at the bar with a man standing outside Jennifer’s
          dressing room, the outside of the club has maintenance signs to make
          sure there isn’t any interruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bank starts to open as people start to going inside, the van pulls
          up and parks nearby. In a side street but still viewing the bank, the
          crew waits a little while to make sure all the customers go into the
          bank. One of the men from the van is a tech. expert who takes out the
          cameras of CCTV through the bank computer system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men then rush out of the van and storm towards bank, carrying
          duffle bags. They enter the bank shouting at people as they franticly
          get down; some tried to escape but couldn’t as the door was secured
          shut. Joey and Carl are instructed by the deputy to go into the safe
          by getting the keys from the manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl, Joey and the deputy head up towards the next floor to the safe.
          The deputy stands guard outside as both Carl and Joey ransack the
          safes for as much money as they can carry. They fill up the bags of at
          least ten million dollars, a million in each bag, two bags to each
          man. As Carl heads to the deputy as he starts giving out the bags down
          to the men in the main ground floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the last two are being sent, the deputy heads down the stairs to
          meet the men as they head to the van, one of the men stays behind to
          wait for Carl and Joey to come down, he watches over the people on the
          main floor. As both Joey and Carl head out of the vault, Joey grabs
          Carl and they start fighting. The fight continues to the bottom floor,
          the man tries to stop it but Joey shoots him. The people in the bank
          start running out of the bank as the fight continues on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deputy looks on and sees the carnage, with most of the money in
          the van, he decides to cut the losses and get ready to drive off, Joey
          hearing the van starting up and seeing them trying to scarper, shoots
          the deputy in the side of the head. The men get out only to be shot by
          both Carl and Joey which was a little reminisce of their early days
          working together in crime. Joey smiles at Carl, and then whacks him in
          the head with his gun, Carl falls to the ground, he then goes to the
          fire alarm and sets it off. Joey looking at the money and the money he
          has and picks up four bags worth six million, he returns the favour
          and kicks Carl in the nuts before running out of the bank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl in pain calls Ritchie who is in a diner, keeping in the area just
          in case and gets his car quickly down to the bank Joey takes a car as
          the van is already spotted and drives off towards Nirvana.
        </p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Joey pulls up at the Plaza to get some important things, his passport
          and documentation knowing he needs to get the money to the Turkish
          man, He is running scared not knowing how he will react knowing half
          the money is at the bank when it should have been just one bag, the
          idea of Carl taking the fall. Luckily is isn’t the Turks first rodeo
          and made sure the deputy and his aren’t connected to him as when it
          comes to the investigation of the deputy and his men deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey is in his office at the plaza getting ready, he knowing that his
          dad has left him a private plane when his dad retired. He rings up on
          his phone the airfield his dad owns in order to arrange an escape. He
          puts his phone in the bag, and then another phone starts to ring,
          which is in his desk draw. The phone is untraceable and is reserved
          for those keep away from cop calls. ”
        </p>
        <p>
          He contemplates answering it while he heads to the door, but it
          continues to ring as Joey packs the bag. He thinking it could be his
          dad answers the phone only to hear Selkan on the other end of the
          phone to check the progress. Joey looks like a rabbit in the
          headlights.
        </p>
        <p>“Hello, I can’t talk right now, I’m just coming to you.”</p>
        <p>“Good Joey, let me speak to my deputy.”</p>
        <p>“I’m afraid that won’t be possible.”</p>
        <p>“Why not?”</p>
        <p>“………He’s dead.”</p>
        <p>“What happened?”</p>
        <p>“…It was Joey…he shot him…he…tried to run off with the money.”</p>
        <p>“Did you leave him there to take the fall?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, the club?”</p>
        <p>“In an hour.”</p>
        <p>“Ok”</p>
        <p>
          Joey heads towards the bottom of the Plaza, happy knowing things will
          work out for him He looks more confident that everything will now work
          out for him. Carl is being framed for the bank robbery, he can pay of
          the Turks and he can enjoy the rest of his life richer than he
          started.
        </p>
        <p>
          He waits in the elevator and exits the elevator, walks down the lobby
          only to be confronted by Carl waiting at the entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stand off to see which one will break first, as Joey goes for his
          gun, Carl shoots him in the shoulder dropping Joey to the floor in
          pain and Carl rushes to him demanding answers.
        </p>
        <p>“Where is she?”</p>
        <p>“Screw You.” Joey squishes in pain.</p>
        <p>
          He steps on Joey’s bloody shoulder that makes Joey screams out in
          pain.
        </p>
        <p>“Where the hell is she?”</p>
        <p>
          “Aaaahh, alright I’ll take you there, she is at the club, he will make
          the exchange when I get the money to him, if he doesn’t see me, he
          will kill her.”
        </p>
        <p>“Well we better get you there now shall we, where’s the money?”</p>
        <p>“My car at the front.”</p>
        <p>
          He drags Joey up and takes him to the car, Carl gets into Joeys car
          and Joey is chucked in the back of the boot. Ritchie goes into his car
          and follows him as they both head to the club. As they travel there,
          Carl gets on the phone and rings Selkan.
        </p>
        <p>“I have the money.”</p>
        <p>“Where is Joey?”</p>
        <p>“He is with me.”</p>
        <p>
          “Do you think I’m playing a game here, all I want is the money, since
          Joey has been a consent disappointment to me, I want him as
          collateral.”
        </p>
        <p>“You got him.” as Carl hangs up the phone and chucks it at Joey.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          They head towards the club, Carl mind full of focus as dealing with
          East Europeans are like playing Russian roulette with a pistol. As he
          pulls up outside the club, Ritchie drives past and parks in the side
          street out of sight, they not knowing if Selkan is alone or with more
          men. Presuming that a bunch of his men are already dead, the chances
          are Selkan is alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Carl waits outside, he sees that the club entrance is still covered
          with maintenance equipment. Joey in the back is wrapped in the
          shoulder to keep Joey mobile and not dead. He waits outside and rings
          Jennifer’s phone, Selkan answers.
        </p>
        <p>“I’m here.”</p>
        <p>
          The entrance opens by the last of the Selkans men, as the man goes to
          search Carl, Carl smashes his head to the wall knocking him out. Carl
          takes the keys from the man for the van parked across the street with
          Ritchie, as ordered by Selkan. He heads down the stairs with his gun
          perched in his trousers and a single duffle bag as he enters the main
          club. Ritchie holds Joey and takes him inside; they shut the doors
          behind them and wait at the top of the stairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Carl enters the main room, Selkan sits at the bar waiting. The
          stage is pitch black with the sound of Jennifer muffled as she is
          gagged out of sight. The mobster has a bottle of Jack Daniels on the
          bar that he is sipping a glass from. Carl stands from the entrance and
          puts down the bag as he looks around scouting the place.
        </p>
        <p>“Ok, lets sort this.”</p>
        <p>
          “In a minute cause I want to tell you a story.” “When I was a young
          lad in Alacati, I visited a farm in which I saw many animals, they
          fascinated me. I saw the farmer’s dog that wasn’t very playful. I
          asked the farmer why, and he said one word to me “Castration.” I asked
          my mother what this word means. She told me that a dog needed his
          balls cut off in order to be controlled. Control is the way, the key
          to get the job done, yes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He gets off the bar and walks towards Carl and he says; “You grab a
          man by the balls by taking the woman he loves, you become his bitch.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Suttle way of putting it, you have the money, now let Jennifer go.”
        </p>
        <p>“Where is Joey?”</p>
        <p>
          “Joey!!” he calls him down, Ritchie makes sure he goes down as he
          stays at the top of the stairs. Joey heads down the stairs and enter
          the main floor, while still in pain from his shoulder. He stops next
          to Carl, looking at Selkan and takes a breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Joey, a simple robbery, in and out, no questions yes. Now I ask, what
          happened to my deputy and my men?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mr Selkan, Carl got greedy and tried to take all the money and flee.”
          Joey saying in confidence despite in pain, in order to save him own
          skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selkan goes face to face with Carl trying to read his eyes to see if
          that is the case. He turns to Joey and points a gun to his head, his
          smiles then laughs at Joey and puts the gun down and walks back to the
          bar to sip another drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Deputies are as you say flies, you squash one, and another one comes
          along, as long as I get what is owed to me, its principle, respect!”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ok you have the money, I delivered Joey to you so let Jennifer go.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Lets have a drink first.” Selkan gets two more glasses, places them
          on the bar and pours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey and Carl try to defuse the situation by playing along, as it
          could turn volatile. As they finish the drinks, Selkan gets up to the
          stairs only to be stopped by the click of a gun pointed by Ritchie. He
          handcuffs him and sends him back downstairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joey and Carl over as Ritchie heads down the stairs only to be shot in
          the head. Carl looks on bewildered and looks at Joey who has a smile
          on his face but with no gun in his hand. He then looks around to see
          what is going on only to see the light on the stage, with Jennifer
          pointing the fired gun; as the smoke disappears from the gun, she
          grins and then points it at Joey.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Baby, that isn’t the plan.” as he walks towards her with a big smile
          on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m just teasing.” She replies smiling, Selkan tries to flee only for
          Joey to grab him and knock him out. He then places him in Malena’s old
          dressing room, Carl tries to intervene but Jennifer points a gun at
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You and him?” Carl confused facing Jennifer. “You got to be kidding,
          you pulled her?” facing Joey “I didn’t think you were about money.”
          Disappointed at Jennifer.
        </p>
        <p>“I’m not, I love him, and he’s my husband.”</p>
        <p>
          “Husband? Jeez you married to this prick, see who wears the pants.”
          Carl says annoyed when the reality sets in on him that being deceived.
          He sees the shiny ring on her finger, which wasn’t there while he met
          her before.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Screw you.” Joey says getting angry at that comment, heads towards
          Carl going face to face with him ready to hit him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Easy baby, come here.” Jennifer calms Joey down with full of swagger
          and confidence, so he then comes towards Jennifer.
        </p>
        <p>“Told you it would work out didn’t I?” Jennifer hugs him.</p>
        <p>
          “Jennifer my dear, you got brains and beauty.” as Joey kisses her
          forehead. He looks at Carl with a smug grin as they hug, knowing that
          he was the one to get the girl. Carl goes to the bar and looks at the
          exit and starts to walk there.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why do you think your going? Did you really think you were getting
          out of this?” Joey says as Jennifer points the gun at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I had my hopes.” as he continues to walk. “Looks like you will
          finally frame me after the third attempt you dumbass. Jennifer, I
          meant every thing I said to you were different to all the others. “As
          he turns to Jennifer and goes to the front door.
        </p>
        <p>“This is to new beginnings.” Jennifer says.</p>
        <p>
          “I guess all those feelings for me was a lie.” Carl says with his back
          to them leaning on the doorframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jeez Carl, I never thought you were this gullible. Shame though,
          because the stone wall that you hold up has turned to nothing more
          than a pile of rubble.” Joey says with confidence as he feels he has
          got the best of Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he looks at the stairs, “Lets get on with it.” he closes his eyes
          as the gun goes off. He then opens his eyes and turns around taking a
          breath. He looks to Jennifer who is still pointing the gun at Carl and
          he looks on perplexed. Joey face has to fear and shock as he looks
          down as another gun to pointed at his chest. Carl looks on in shock,
          Jennifer’s expression doesn’t change as she looks at Joey falling to
          the floor. She kneels over him and kisses him on the forehead as he
          trembles and dies. She then turns to Carl with a smile on her face as
          she points the gun she shot Joey next to him, wipes it and places it
          in Joey’s hand. Carl doesn’t know what to do as he stands there
          looking at her, she holds down the other gun that was pointed at Carl.
        </p>
        <p>
          He goes to the bar confused and picks up the bottle and places it on
          the table, he sits on the chair looking at the bottle. He pours a
          drink from the bottle into the glass and starts mumbling to himself
          trying to figure out what is going on, as he continues to mumble, he
          snaps and slaps the bottle across which smashes off the side of the
          bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m sick of drinking” Carl says calmly. He gets up and gets his gun
          out and heads towards Joey’s body. He looks over Joey’s body staring
          at him with no expression on his face, as he is relieved that the
          issues they had in the past are now over but still perplexed on the
          whole situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Why did you do that? Why didn’t you tell me about Kiera?” as he turns
          towards Jennifer downbeat but not angry.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What did you think? Did you think that Kiera was bounded up in a
          cage? He cared her for, during that time despite his faults he did
          care for her when they worked together. I gave her a home in order to
          find her feet, we got close funny girl. I never had a sister so it was
          nice you now know.” She is explaining the situation reminiscing
          happily.
        </p>
        <p>“Why is hell would she stay there unless she was forced?”</p>
        <p>“He saved her life and she believes there was good in him maybe.”</p>
        <p>“Manipulation.”</p>
        <p>“No, Kindness.” Jennifer walks towards him over Joey’s body.</p>
        <p>“Why did you kill him then?”</p>
        <p>“Because I don’t want him, I want you.”</p>
        <p>
          “Funny way to show kindness, he wanted to kill her in front of my
          eyes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Come on, do you think he was going through with that, what happens
          was an accident. The death was down to your mate over there.” As she
          points towards Ritchie’s body.
        </p>
        <p>“So what now, you want me, I’m confused.” Carl ponders.</p>
        <p>
          “I’m fed up of running this club, probably time to sell up and leave.”
          Jennifer thinks for a bit. “Come with me.” She suggests.
        </p>
        <p>“Come on, I know you’re smarter than that.”</p>
        <p>
          “The plaza is a nice base and money earner with the money injection,
          with more to set us up for life. I can finally own my theatre and star
          in many more, singing in Broadway, Las Vegas, London wherever.”
        </p>
        <p>“Do you think I believe that?”</p>
        <p>“Everything I said was one hundred percent true.”</p>
        <p>
          “I’m done with this, just take the money and go.” Carl was still
          trying to fight his feelings for Jennifer.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Not without you.” She starts to get a little emotional. He grabs her
          and takes her to the bar in passion, they are face to face and she
          kisses him. They then kiss passionately.
        </p>
        <p>“I must be crazy.” He says with a smile on his face.</p>
        <p>
          “What about him?” as Carl looks at the dressing room where Selkan is
          still handcuffed to the radiator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl picks up some crates that contain bottles of spirits. He chucks
          one at the stage and adds one or two more crates around the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jennifer comes down from the stairs with two bags of the money and
          puts it down next to Joey. Carl looks at her with a smile on his face,
          they head to the top of the stairs and Carl gets the van’s keys. They
          get two bottles and pour it down the stairs and both head outside to
          see if the coast is clear, Jennifer lights a match and throws it into
          the spirits as it catches alight.
        </p>
        <p>
          They head into the van with the other bags of money and drives off
          down the street, moments later the club explodes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          As the weeks past, the case into the clubs explosion was investigated
          by the LAPD. As Selkan was killed, the CIA had got involved as Selkan
          was wanted by them from previous crimes including murder, torture,
          money laundering to name a few. There was a tug of war between the CIA
          and LAPD on running the investigation as Ritchie was found at the
          scene through his dental records and his badge identified him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on, there with no leads as they explored very avenue. But
          the CIA wanted to place it on Selkan to shut the case. The LAPD seeing
          that the case as straight forward despite the two other bodies not
          identified, just seeing it an arrest gone wrong. They closed the case
          eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while the case was being examined, James Wagner who is Ritchie’s
          brother who is part of the CIA doesn’t believe that the case was as
          simple as that. He hasn’t seen Ritchie in recent months but could
          sense that things weren’t right him. He sees that Carl has disappeared
          and with the robbery, warehouse crimes coming so close together with
          small connections that he starts to find with further digging, He gets
          more and curious of Carl.
        </p>
        <p>Will he uncover more about Carl as he continues on the chase?</p>
        <p>
          Months Later, Carl is standing on the Miami peer looking out at people
          having fun on the beach, motivated fitness huge muscled men and women
          in the outdoor gym, surfers riding the waves and much more. As he
          looks out to the sea, Jennifer comes up next to him, hands him an ice
          cream and they both look out enjoying an ice cream. They are now
          together and happy, as Carl and Jennifer may have both find what they
          were searching for.
        </p>
        <p>“You happy?” She asks him.</p>
        <p>“You know what, with you yeah.” He replies wondering.</p>
        <p>“Do you feel safe?” She ponders.</p>
        <p>They both look on out towards the sea.</p>
        <p>
          They are now in Las Vegas, which Jennifer now completely owns Joey’s
          estate, jets, everything left by Marciano Snr to Joey, she gets from
          his death. Jennifer is working on Broadway like she wanted where she
          owns a theatre company giving young actors/singers the chances like
          she tried for while growing up. She is on tour in London playing the
          lead role as Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls and loving every
          minute of it.

          While the show is being performed one night, Carl is watching the
          show, a big smile on his face as he hears her singing, reminisce of
          the times he saw her in the club.
        </p>
        <p>
          The question that needs to be asked is this; how can a relationship
          that is being made by love and lust, but is mixed with greed, deceit
          and potential threats from old enemies, police, new threats ever last?
