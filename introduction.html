        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In Chicago Illinois, a cop is sitting in his cop car opposite a large
          industrial building. He waits as a long lorry truck heads to the
          entrance and is escorted inside by a security guard at the gate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The copper holds his walkie-talkie and says, “we are a good to go, and
          we are good to go.”
        </p>
        <p>“10-4” the voice through the walkie-talkie replies.</p>
        <p>
          The copper then comes out of the car and sneaks his way towards the
          gate and ambushes the security guard. As the security guard is on the
          ground tied up and gagged, the copper activates the gate just as a
          black van comes from the corner and enters the archway entrance
          towards the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the van are two rows opposite each other, filled with policemen
          and woman suited up in balaclavas awaiting final instruction from the
          main lieutenant called James.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Ok, you know the drill.” As he holds up a picture of a girl called
          Kiera, mid 20s in a police uniform. He then also holds up another
          picture of a guy called Carl, also mid 20s both of them in police
          uniform posing like a graduation with the biggest grins on their
          faces. Just like all fresh coppers do when they think that they are
          going to make a difference, no naïve.
        </p>
        <p>
          “These two are not to be touched, me and Sampson will deal with them.
          They will be in plain clothes, undercover, so be discreet when
          approaching them.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Make sure Marciano is apprehended and if there is a crossfire
          situation, I rather see them in a cell than in the morgue, they need
          to stand trial.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As they head in, the crossfire became a reality and the police and
          Marciano men exchanging bullets.
